We are at a remarkable moment in time. ,12.231,16.256,4.025,2093
We face over the next two decades ,16.256,19.192,2.936,2093
two fundamental transformations ,19.192,21.258,2.066,2093
that will determine whether the next 100 years ,21.258,24.3,3.042,2093
is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries. ,24.3,28.485,4.185,2093
Let me illustrate with an example. ,28.485,31.207,2.722,2093
I first visited Beijing 25 years ago ,31.207,34.481,3.274,2093
to teach at the People's University of China. ,34.481,37.507,3.026,2093
China was getting serious about market economics ,37.507,40.443,2.936,2093
"and about university education, ",40.443,42.782,2.339,2093
so they decided to call in the foreign experts. ,42.782,47.273,4.491,2093
"Like most other people, ",47.273,48.878,1.605,2093
I moved around Beijing by bicycle. ,48.878,51.694,2.816,2093
"Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle, ",51.694,53.888,2.194,2093
it was a safe and easy way to get around. ,53.888,57.195,3.307,2093
Cycling in Beijing now ,57.195,58.559,1.364,2093
is a completely different prospect. ,58.559,61.38,2.821,2093
The roads are jammed by cars and trucks. ,61.38,64.523,3.143,2093
The air is dangerously polluted ,64.523,66.322,1.799,2093
from the burning of coal and diesel. ,66.322,69.934,3.612,2093
"When I was there last in the spring, ",69.934,72.072,2.138,2093
there was an advisory for people of my age ??,72.072,74.85,2.778,2093
over 65 ??,74.85,77.28,2.43,2093
to stay indoors and not move much. ,77.28,80.149,2.869,2093
How did this come about? ,80.149,82.083,1.934,2093
It came from the way in which ,82.083,84.503,2.42,2093
Beijing has grown as a city. ,84.503,86.768,2.265,2093
"It's doubled over those 25 years, more than doubled, ",86.768,89.228,2.46,2093
from 10 million to 20 million. ,89.228,91.404,2.176,2093
It's become a sprawling urban area ,91.404,93.097,1.693,2093
"dependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy, ",93.097,97.456,4.359,2093
particularly coal. ,97.456,99.279,1.823,2093
"China burns half the world's coal each year, ",99.279,103.554,4.275,2093
"and that's why, it is a key reason why, ",103.554,107.468,3.914,2093
it is the world's largest emitter ,107.468,109.493,2.025,2093
of greenhouse gases. ,109.493,112.407,2.914,2093
"At the same time, we have to recognize ",112.407,114.521,2.114,2093
that in that period China has grown remarkably. ,114.521,117.705,3.184,2093
It has become the world's second largest economy. ,117.705,120.146,2.441,2093
Hundreds of millions of people ,120.146,121.615,1.469,2093
have been lifted out of poverty. ,121.615,123.78,2.165,2093
That's really important. ,123.78,125.861,2.081,2093
"But at the same time, the people of China ",125.861,128.178,2.317,2093
are asking the question: ,128.178,129.778,1.6,2093
What's the value of this growth ,129.778,131.358,1.58,2093
if our cities are unlivable? ,131.358,133.483,2.125,2093
"They've analyzed, diagnosed ",133.483,135.795,2.312,2093
that this is an unsustainable path of growth ,135.795,139.135,3.34,2093
and development. ,139.135,141.261,2.126,2093
China's planning to scale back coal. ,141.261,143.59,2.329,2093
It's looking to build its cities in different ways. ,143.59,149.451,5.861,2093
"Now, the growth of China ",149.451,151.284,1.833,2093
"is part of a dramatic change, fundamental change, ",151.284,155.008,3.724,2093
in the structure of the world economy. ,155.008,157.775,2.767,2093
"Just 25 years ago, the developing countries, ",157.775,160.497,2.722,2093
"the poorer countries of the world, ",160.497,162.387,1.89,2093
"were, notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people,",162.387,166.313,3.926,2093
they accounted for only about a third ,166.313,168.136,1.823,2093
of the world's output. ,168.136,170.128,1.992,2093
Now it's more than half; ,170.128,171.872,1.744,2093
"25 years from now, it will probably be two thirds ",171.872,174.843,2.971,2093
from the countries that we saw 25 years ago ,174.843,177.948,3.105,2093
as developing. ,177.948,179.224,1.276,2093
That's a remarkable change. ,179.224,180.822,1.598,2093
"It means that most countries around the world, ",180.822,183.224,2.402,2093
"rich or poor, are going to be facing ",183.224,185.283,2.059,2093
the two fundamental transformations ,185.283,187.263,1.98,2093
that I want to talk about and highlight. ,187.263,190.448,3.185,2093
"Now, the first of these transformations ",190.448,192.461,2.013,2093
is the basic structural change ,192.461,195.068,2.607,2093
of the economies and societies ,195.068,196.808,1.74,2093
that I've already begun to illustrate ,196.808,198.838,2.03,2093
through the description of Beijing. ,198.838,202.348,3.51,2093
Fifty percent now in urban areas. ,202.348,205.307,2.959,2093
That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050. ,205.307,208.918,3.611,2093
"Over the next two decades, we'll see ",208.918,211.179,2.261,2093
"the demand for energy rise by 40 percent, ",211.179,214.092,2.913,2093
and the growth in the economy and in the population ,214.092,218.066,3.974,2093
"is putting increasing pressure on our land, ",218.066,221.048,2.982,2093
on our water and on our forests. ,221.048,224.914,3.866,2093
This is profound structural change. ,224.914,228.199,3.285,2093
If we manage it in a negligent ,228.199,229.774,1.575,2093
"or a shortsighted way, ",229.774,232.393,2.619,2093
"we will create waste, pollution, congestion, ",232.393,236.259,3.866,2093
destruction of land and forests. ,236.259,239.809,3.55,2093
If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated ,239.809,242.137,2.328,2093
"with my numbers ??cities, energy, land ??",242.137,245.86,3.723,2093
"if we manage all that badly, ",245.86,247.739,1.879,2093
then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods ,247.739,249.82,2.081,2093
of the people around the world ,249.82,251.631,1.811,2093
would be poor and damaged. ,251.631,254.624,2.993,2093
"And more than that, ",254.624,256.446,1.822,2093
"the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise, ",256.446,259.754,3.308,2093
with immense risks to our climate. ,259.754,263.635,3.881,2093
Concentrations of greenhouse gases ,263.635,265.682,2.047,2093
in the atmosphere are already ,265.682,268.6,2.918,2093
higher than they've been for millions of years. ,268.6,272.234,3.634,2093
"If we go on increasing those concentrations, ",272.234,275.872,3.638,2093
we risk temperatures over the next century or so ,275.872,279.246,3.374,2093
that we have not seen on this planet ,279.246,280.863,1.617,2093
for tens of millions of years. ,280.863,284.068,3.205,2093
We've been around as Homo sapiens ??,284.068,286.194,2.126,2093
"that's a rather generous definition, sapiens ??",286.194,289.365,3.171,2093
"for perhaps a quarter of a million years, a quarter of a million.",289.365,292.168,2.803,2093
We risk temperatures we haven't seen ,292.168,293.399,1.231,2093
for tens of millions of years over a century. ,293.399,298.138,4.739,2093
That would transform the relationship ,298.138,300.208,2.07,2093
between human beings and the planet. ,300.208,304.437,4.229,2093
"It would lead to changing deserts, ",304.437,309.088,4.651,2093
"changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes, ",309.088,312.278,3.19,2093
"changing sea levels, ",312.278,313.516,1.238,2093
"hundreds of millions of people, ",313.516,316.159,2.643,2093
"perhaps billions of people who would have to move, ",316.159,319.388,3.229,2093
"and if we've learned anything from history, ",319.388,321.311,1.923,2093
that means severe and extended conflict. ,321.311,323.623,2.312,2093
And we couldn't just turn it off. ,323.623,325.501,1.878,2093
You can't make a peace treaty with the planet. ,325.501,327.931,2.43,2093
You can't negotiate with the laws of physics. ,327.931,330.158,2.227,2093
You're in there. You're stuck. ,330.158,331.873,1.715,2093
"Those are the stakes we're playing for, ",331.873,333.549,1.676,2093
"and that's why we have to make this second transformation,",333.549,336.271,2.722,2093
"the climate transformation, ",336.271,337.911,1.64,2093
and move to a low-carbon economy. ,337.911,340.294,2.383,2093
"Now, the first of these transformations ",340.294,342.672,2.378,2093
is going to happen anyway. ,342.672,343.753,1.081,2093
"We have to decide whether to do it well or badly, ",343.753,345.602,1.849,2093
"the economic, or structural, transformation. ",345.602,348.42,2.818,2093
"But the second of the transformations, ",348.42,350.31,1.89,2093
"the climate transformations, we have to decide to do. ",350.31,354.424,4.114,2093
Those two transformations face us ,354.424,356.643,2.219,2093
in the next two decades. ,356.643,358.816,2.173,2093
The next two decades are decisive ,358.816,362.029,3.213,2093
for what we have to do. ,362.029,364.744,2.715,2093
"Now, the more I've thought about this, ",364.744,366.263,1.519,2093
"the two transformations coming together, ",366.263,368.367,2.104,2093
the more I've come to realize ,368.367,369.914,1.547,2093
that this is an enormous opportunity. ,369.914,372.866,2.952,2093
It's an opportunity which we can use ,372.866,375.093,2.227,2093
or it's an opportunity which we can lose. ,375.093,378.49,3.397,2093
And let me explain through those three key areas ,378.49,381.213,2.723,2093
"that I've identified: cities, energy and land. ",381.213,383.923,2.71,2093
And let me start with cities. ,383.923,385.977,2.054,2093
I've already described the problems of Beijing: ,385.977,390.01,4.033,2093
"pollution, congestion, waste and so on. ",390.01,392.856,2.846,2093
Surely we recognize that in many of our cities ,392.856,396.546,3.69,2093
around the world. ,396.546,397.805,1.259,2093
"Now, with cities, like life but particularly cities, ",397.805,400.73,2.925,2093
you have to think ahead. ,400.73,403.794,3.064,2093
The cities that are going to be built ??,403.794,405.208,1.414,2093
"and there are many, and many big ones ??",405.208,407.364,2.156,2093
we have to think of how to design them ,407.364,408.828,1.464,2093
in a compact way ,408.828,410.179,1.351,2093
so we can save travel time  and we can save energy.,410.179,413.622,3.443,2093
"The cities that already are  there, well established,",413.622,417.537,3.915,2093
we have to think about renewal and investment in them,417.537,420.608,3.071,2093
so that we can connect ourselves much better ,420.608,423.386,2.778,2093
"within those cities, and make it easier, ",423.386,425.778,2.392,2093
"encourage more people, to live closer to the center. ",425.778,429.369,3.591,2093
We've got examples building around the world ,429.369,431.779,2.41,2093
of the kinds of ways in which we can do that. ,431.779,434.071,2.292,2093
The bus rapid transport system in Bogotá in Colombia ,434.071,438.089,4.018,2093
is a very important case of how to move around ,438.089,440.721,2.632,2093
safely and quickly in a non-polluting way ,440.721,443.291,2.57,2093
"in a city: very frequent buses, ",443.291,446.486,3.195,2093
"strongly protected routes, the same service, really, ",446.486,449.423,2.937,2093
"as an underground railway system, ",449.423,451.514,2.091,2093
"but much, much cheaper ",451.514,453.325,1.811,2093
"and can be done much more quickly, ",453.325,455.733,2.408,2093
a brilliant idea in many more cities ,455.733,457.628,1.895,2093
around the world that's developing. ,457.628,459.664,2.036,2093
"Now, some things in cities do take time. ",459.664,461.565,1.901,2093
Some things in cities can happen much more quickly. ,461.565,464.618,3.053,2093
"Take my hometown, London. ",464.618,466.722,2.104,2093
"In 1952, smog in London killed 4,000 people ",466.722,472.01,5.288,2093
"and badly damaged the lives of many, many more. ",472.01,474.704,2.694,2093
And it happened all the time. ,474.704,476.054,1.35,2093
For those of you live outside London in the U.K. ,476.054,478.556,2.502,2093
will remember it used to be called The Smoke. ,478.556,480.749,2.193,2093
That's the way London was. ,480.749,482.425,1.676,2093
"By regulating coal, within a few years ",482.425,484.507,2.082,2093
the problems of smog were rapidly reduced. ,484.507,487.595,3.088,2093
I remember the smogs well. ,487.595,489.15,1.555,2093
When the visibility dropped to [less] than ,489.15,491.873,2.723,2093
"a few meters, ",491.873,493.866,1.993,2093
they stopped the buses and I had to walk. ,493.866,495.722,1.856,2093
This was the 1950s. ,495.722,497.78,2.058,2093
I had to walk home three miles from school. ,497.78,501.678,3.898,2093
"Again, breathing was a hazardous activity. ",501.678,505.247,3.569,2093
But it was changed. It was changed by a decision. ,505.247,507.925,2.678,2093
"Good decisions can bring good results, ",507.925,511.094,3.169,2093
"striking results, quickly. ",511.094,513.459,2.365,2093
"We've seen more: In London, we've introduced the congestion charge,",513.459,516.452,2.993,2093
"actually quite quickly and effectively, ",516.452,519.158,2.706,2093
and we've seen great improvements ,519.158,520.778,1.62,2093
"in the bus system, and cleaned up the bus system. ",520.778,524.74,3.962,2093
"You can see that the two transformations I've described,",524.74,527.86,3.12,2093
"the structural and the climate, ",527.86,529.816,1.956,2093
come very much together. ,529.816,532.448,2.632,2093
"But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities, ",532.448,535.381,2.933,2093
"and we have to invest wisely, and if we do, ",535.381,537.914,2.533,2093
"we'll see cleaner cities, quieter cities, safer cities, ",537.914,542.45,4.536,2093
"more attractive cities, more productive cities, ",542.45,545.107,2.657,2093
and stronger community in those cities ??,545.107,547.874,2.767,2093
"public transport, recycling, reusing, ",547.874,550.122,2.248,2093
all sorts of things that bring communities together. ,550.122,554.171,4.049,2093
"We can do that, but we have to think, ",554.171,556.028,1.857,2093
"we have to invest, we have to plan. ",556.028,558.308,2.28,2093
Let me turn to energy. ,558.308,560.479,2.171,2093
"Now, energy over the last 25 years ",560.479,563.701,3.222,2093
has increased by about 50 percent. ,563.701,565.937,2.236,2093
Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels. ,565.937,568.554,2.617,2093
"Over the next 20 years, ",568.554,570.212,1.658,2093
perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so. ,570.212,573.988,3.776,2093
"We have to invest strongly in energy, ",573.988,576.522,2.534,2093
"we have to use it much more efficiently, ",576.522,579.796,3.274,2093
and we have to make it clean. ,579.796,581.484,1.688,2093
We can see how to do that. ,581.484,582.814,1.33,2093
Take the example of California. ,582.814,584.718,1.904,2093
It would be in the top 10 countries in the world ,584.718,587.328,2.61,2093
if it was independent. ,587.328,589.871,2.543,2093

(Laughter) ,592.436,595.934,3.498,2093
California's a big place. ,595.934,597.779,1.845,2093

"In the next five or six years, ",599.827,602.568,2.741,2093
they will likely move from ,602.568,605.282,2.714,2093

"to over 33 percent, ",609.278,611.751,2.473,2093
and that would bring California back ,611.751,614.19,2.439,2093
to greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 ,614.19,616.723,2.533,2093
"to where they were in 1990, ",616.723,618.68,1.957,2093
a period when the economy in California ,618.68,620.424,1.744,2093
would more or less have doubled. ,620.424,621.856,1.432,2093
That's a striking achievement. ,621.856,623.306,1.45,2093
It shows what can be done. ,623.306,624.789,1.483,2093
Not just California ??the  incoming government of India,624.789,628.096,3.307,2093
is planning to get solar technology ,628.096,631.122,3.026,2093
to light up the homes ,631.122,632.494,1.372,2093

who don't have electricity in India. ,634.204,636.269,2.065,2093
They've set themselves a target of five years. ,636.269,638.749,2.48,2093
I think they've got a good chance of doing that. ,638.749,641.978,3.229,2093
"We'll see, but what you're seeing now ",641.978,644.637,2.659,2093
is people moving much more quickly. ,644.637,646.948,2.311,2093

"and the climate and the low carbon, ",665.871,667.862,1.991,2093
are intimately intertwined. ,667.862,670.405,2.543,2093
"Do the first one well, the structural, ",670.405,672.227,1.822,2093
the second one on the climate ,672.227,674.208,1.981,2093
becomes much easier. ,674.208,677.39,3.182,2093
"Look at land, ",677.39,679.179,1.789,2093
land and particularly forests. ,679.179,681.767,2.588,2093
Forests are the hosts to valuable ,681.767,684.827,3.06,2093
plant and animal species. ,684.827,687.356,2.529,2093

and much more has been degraded. ,702.893,705.356,2.463,2093
But we're already seeing ,705.356,707.111,1.755,2093
that we can do so much about that. ,707.111,709.518,2.407,2093
"We can recognize the problem, but we can also ",709.518,711.555,2.037,2093
understand how to tackle it. ,711.555,713.669,2.114,2093
"In Brazil, the rate of deforestation ",713.669,716.324,2.655,2093

"That's of course of first and fundamental importance, ",734.344,736.785,2.441,2093

You're seeing what can be done. ,775.915,777.181,1.266,2093
Ethiopia is investing in clean energy. ,777.181,779.746,2.565,2093

will be the worst of centuries. ,900.562,903.293,2.731,2093
That's the major conclusion ,903.293,905.185,1.892,2093
of the report on the economy and climate ,905.185,908.316,3.131,2093

"and I co-chaired that with him, ",912.185,914.365,2.18,2093
and we handed that report yesterday ,914.365,916.318,1.953,2093
"here in New York, in the United Nations Building ",916.318,919.308,2.99,2093

"Now, two weeks ago, ",926.151,929.533,3.382,2093

Two weeks old. ,958.828,961.796,2.968,2093
Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye ,961.796,967.483,5.687,2093
"and tell them that we understood the issues, ",967.483,971.23,3.747,2093
"that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities, ",971.23,974.548,3.318,2093
and still we failed to act? ,974.548,978.789,4.241,2093
Surely not. Let's make the next 100 years ,978.789,982.268,3.479,2093
the best of centuries. ,982.268,984.074,1.806,2093
"Over the past couple of days, ",25.802,27.191,1.389,21
"as I've been preparing for my speech, ",27.215,28.992,1.777,21
I've become more and more nervous about what I'm going to say,29.016,32.556,3.54,21
and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people.,32.58,35.699,3.119,21
"Being on the same stage as Al Gore, who was the first person I ever voted for.",35.723,40.013,4.29,21
And -- ,40.037,41.197,1.16,21
(Laughter) ,41.221,44.834,3.613,21
So I was getting pretty nervous ,44.858,46.648,1.79,21
"and, you know, I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage,",46.672,49.477,2.805,21
and that's more nerve-racking. ,49.501,50.985,1.484,21
But then I started thinking about my family.,51.009,53.065,2.056,21
I started thinking about my father and my grandfather,53.089,55.834,2.745,21
"and my great-grandfather, ",55.858,57.921,2.063,21
and I realized ,57.945,59.613,1.668,21
that I had all of these Teds going through my bloodstream --,59.637,63.883,4.246,21
(Laughter) ,63.907,65.305,1.398,21
"that I had to consider this ""my element."" ",65.329,68.834,3.505,21
"So, who am I? ",68.858,71.235,2.377,21
Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband.,71.259,74.888,3.629,21
We have about 125 people internationally. ,74.912,77.331,2.419,21
"If you looked in the book, ",77.355,78.834,1.479,21
you saw this ... ,78.858,80.442,1.584,21
(Laughter) ,80.466,81.735,1.269,21
which I really was appalled by. ,81.759,85.031,3.272,21
(Laughter) ,85.055,87.458,2.403,21
"And because I wanted to impress you all with slides,",87.482,90.834,3.352,21
"since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs,",90.858,93.596,2.738,21
"I made a graph that moves, ",93.62,95.938,2.318,21
and I talk about the makeup of me. ,95.962,98.834,2.872,21
(Laughter) ,98.858,102.204,3.346,21
"So, besides this freakish thing, ",102.228,104.281,2.053,21
this is my science slide. ,104.305,105.557,1.252,21
"This is math, and this is science, this is genetics.",105.581,108.149,2.568,21

(Laughter) ,111.069,113.017,1.948,21
So -- ,113.041,114.297,1.256,21
"I'm a blogger, which, probably, to a lot of you, means different things.",115.021,119.077,4.056,21
"You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha,",119.101,123.153,4.052,21
where a blogger talked about how you hack ,123.177,125.161,1.984,21
"or break into a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen,",125.185,127.834,2.649,21

"Kryptonite had to adjust the lock, ",129.231,131.197,1.966,21

"You may have heard about Rathergate, ",134.858,136.833,1.975,21
which was basically the result of bloggers ,136.857,139.964,3.107,21
"realizing that the ""th"" in 111 ",139.988,144.008,4.02,21

it's on Word. ,147.229,148.505,1.276,21
"Bloggers exposed this, ",148.529,150.242,1.713,21
or they worked hard to expose this. ,150.266,152.834,2.568,21
"You know, blogs are scary. This is what you see.",152.858,155.425,2.567,21
"I see this, and I'm sure scared -- I swear on stage -- shitless about blogs,",155.449,160.922,5.473,21
because this is not something that's friendly.,160.946,163.93,2.984,21
But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news,163.954,167.58,3.626,21
"and consume media, and these are great examples.",167.604,170.001,2.397,21

"if not millions, of readers, ",172.334,174.18,1.846,21
and that's incredibly important. ,174.204,175.834,1.63,21
"During the hurricane, ",175.858,177.834,1.976,21
"you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog,",177.858,181.172,3.314,21
updating it frequently. ,181.196,182.538,1.342,21
This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools.,182.562,185.834,3.272,21
"You have my friend, ",185.858,187.573,1.715,21

"That's all he does now, ",196.291,197.442,1.151,21

"And then you have something like this, which is Interplast.",199.932,202.716,2.784,21
It's a wonderful organization ,202.74,204.318,1.578,21
of people and doctors who go to developing nations,204.342,208.527,4.185,21

That's what I am. I'm a blogger. ,222.809,224.402,1.593,21
"I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing,",224.426,227.955,3.529,21
"and I am an expert on this person, ",227.979,230.209,2.23,21
and so I write about it. ,230.233,232.398,2.165,21
"So, the short story about my blog: ",232.7,234.343,1.643,21
"it started in 2001, I was 23. ",234.367,236.518,2.151,21
"I wasn't happy with my job, ",236.542,238.266,1.724,21
"because I was a designer, ",238.29,239.742,1.452,21
but I wasn't being really stimulated. ,239.766,241.686,1.92,21
I was an English major in college. ,241.71,243.343,1.633,21
"I didn't have any use for it, but I missed writing.",243.367,246.042,2.675,21
"So, I started to write a blog ",246.066,247.7,1.634,21
and I started to create things like these little stories.,247.724,250.597,2.873,21
"This was an illustration about my camp experience when I was 11 years old,",250.621,254.834,4.213,21
"and how I went to a YMCA camp, Christian camp,",254.858,257.834,2.976,21
"and basically by the end, ",257.858,259.474,1.616,21
"I had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk,",259.498,264.378,4.88,21
"They couldn't find me, they sent a search party,",264.402,266.658,2.256,21
and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself --,266.682,269.659,2.977,21
jumped off Bible Peak. ,269.683,271.525,1.842,21
"You can laugh, this is OK. ",271.549,273.194,1.645,21
(Laughter) ,273.218,274.61,1.392,21
This is me. ,274.634,276.834,2.2,21
This is what happened to me. ,276.858,278.327,1.469,21
"And when I started my blog, it was really this one goal --",278.351,281.834,3.483,21
"I said, ""I am not going to be famous to the world,",281.858,287.554,5.696,21
"but I could be famous to people on the Internet.""",287.578,290.032,2.454,21
And I set a goal. ,290.056,291.216,1.16,21
"I said, ""I'm going to win an award,"" ",291.24,293.626,2.386,21
because I had never won an award in my entire life.,293.65,296.068,2.418,21
"And I said, ""I'm going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award.""",296.092,300.023,3.931,21
"And I won it -- I reached all of these people,",300.047,302.834,2.787,21
and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day.,302.858,306.345,3.487,21
And then I wrote a post about a banjo. ,306.369,308.796,2.427,21
I wrote a post ,309.177,310.915,1.738,21
about wanting to buy a banjo -- ,310.939,313.495,2.556,21
"a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money. ",313.519,315.971,2.452,21

"and I said, ""I could do that."" ",325.262,326.834,1.572,21

"""Ben, can I buy a banjo?"" And he's like, ""No.""",328.175,330.365,2.19,21
And my husband -- ,330.389,331.62,1.231,21
(Laughter) ,331.644,332.806,1.162,21
"this is my husband, who is very hot -- ",332.83,334.874,2.044,21
he won an award for being hot. ,334.898,336.834,1.936,21

"And I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him,",346.057,349.93,3.873,21
he was such a tyrant -- he would not let me buy this banjo.,349.954,352.803,2.849,21
And those people who know me understood my joke --,352.827,355.189,2.362,21
"this is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people.",355.213,357.562,2.349,21
"Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant,",357.586,360.834,3.248,21
this person is so loving and so sweet ,360.858,362.834,1.976,21
that he lets me dress him up ,362.858,364.647,1.789,21
and post pictures of him to my blog. ,364.671,367.761,3.09,21
(Laughter) ,367.785,371.608,3.823,21
And if he knew I was showing this right now -- I put this in today --,371.632,374.958,3.326,21
he would kill me. ,374.982,376.815,1.833,21
"But the thing was, my friends read it, ",376.839,379.159,2.32,21
"and they're like, ""Oh, that Mena, she wrote a post",379.183,381.61,2.427,21
"about wanting a stupid thing and being stupid.""",381.634,384.102,2.468,21

"And why are they reading this?"" ",411.32,412.834,1.514,21
And I realized: I don't want to reach these people.,412.858,415.243,2.385,21
I don't want to write for this public audience.,415.267,417.834,2.567,21
And I started to kill my blog slowly. ,417.858,419.834,1.976,21
"I'm like, I don't want to write this anymore.",419.858,421.96,2.102,21
Slowly and slowly -- ,421.984,423.604,1.62,21
And I did tell personal stories from time to time.,423.628,426.616,2.988,21
"I wrote this one, and I put this up because of Einstein today.",426.64,429.552,2.912,21

"You know, you read the blogs about politics or about media,",442.158,444.949,2.791,21

"These are out there, ",446.527,447.685,1.158,21

"You see Norman Rockwell, and you have art critics say,",453.15,455.703,2.553,21

"and this is not something to be considered high art.""",460.334,463.834,3.5,21
And I think this is one of the most important things,463.858,466.641,2.783,21
to us as humans. ,466.665,468.903,2.238,21
"These things resonate with us, ",468.927,471.525,2.598,21
"and, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs,",471.549,474.573,3.024,21
"the history paintings about, you know, all the biblical stories,",474.597,478.563,3.966,21
and then you have this. ,478.587,479.738,1.151,21
These are the blogs that interest me: the people that just tell stories.,479.762,483.454,3.692,21
"One story is about this baby, and his name is Odin.",483.478,487.422,3.944,21
His father was a blogger. ,487.446,489.628,2.182,21
"And he was writing his blog one day, ",489.652,492.522,2.87,21
and his wife gave birth to her baby ,492.546,495.147,2.601,21
at 25 weeks. ,495.171,496.834,1.663,21

"One day, it was normal; the next day, it was hell.",498.631,501.834,3.203,21
And this is a one-pound baby. ,501.858,503.632,1.774,21
So Odin was documented every single day. ,503.656,506.834,3.178,21
"Pictures were taken every day: day one, day two ...",506.858,509.53,2.672,21
You have day nine -- they're talking about his apnea;,509.554,512.443,2.889,21
day 39 -- he gets pneumonia. ,512.467,514.324,1.857,21
"His baby is so small, ",514.348,515.834,1.486,21

"But then it gets better. Day 96, he goes home.",535.858,539.07,3.212,21
And you see this post. ,539.094,541.18,2.086,21
That's not something you're going to see in a paper or magazine,541.204,544.234,3.03,21
"but this is something this person feels, ",544.258,546.212,1.954,21

"That's not a huge amount of people reading,",548.641,550.704,2.063,21
but 28 people matter. ,550.728,552.498,1.77,21
"And today, he is a healthy baby, ",552.522,555.433,2.911,21

"So, blogs. ",571.175,572.716,1.541,21
So what? You've probably heard these things before.,572.74,575.287,2.547,21
"We talked about the WELL, and about all these sorts of things",575.311,578.954,3.643,21
throughout our online history. ,578.978,580.834,1.856,21
"But I think blogs are basically just an evolution,",580.858,584.496,3.638,21
and that's where we are today. ,584.52,586.163,1.643,21
"It's this record of who you are, your persona.",586.187,588.783,2.596,21
"You have your Google search, where you say, ""What is Mena Trott?""",588.807,591.872,3.065,21

"But then you also find people's blogs, ",595.666,597.834,2.168,21

"not necessarily about the same topic, but things that interest them.",600.78,604.7,3.92,21

"I'm like, ""We've got to reach all these people.""",611.615,613.873,2.258,21

"We're getting into China, we want to be there,",616,618.146,2.146,21
but there are so many people that won't have the access to write a blog.,618.17,621.871,3.701,21
"But to see something like the $100 computer is amazing,",621.895,624.632,2.737,21

"We have a successful company because of timing,",626.73,628.973,2.243,21

it's not rocket science. ,631.529,633.04,1.511,21
"And so, that's an amazing thing to consider.",633.064,636.064,3,21
So -- ,636.473,637.893,1.42,21
the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important.,639.152,644.021,4.869,21
"And we started with a slide of my Teds, ",644.045,646.342,2.297,21
"and I had to add this slide, ",646.366,648.024,1.658,21
"because I knew the minute I showed this, my mom --",648.048,650.418,2.37,21

"So, I have all the people that I know of. ",656.761,659.031,2.27,21
But this is basically the extent of the family that I know,659.055,662.981,3.926,21
in terms of my direct line. ,663.005,665.889,2.884,21
"I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before, and this one, I grew up with,",665.913,669.996,4.083,21
looking at constantly. ,670.02,671.834,1.814,21

"This is not science, but this was enough for me",680.524,684.451,3.927,21

and how we can trace our line. ,687.858,690.132,2.274,21
So that has always influenced me. ,690.608,692.834,2.226,21
"I have this record, this 1910 census, ",693.143,696.755,3.612,21

"Just doing this, I spent time in the archives --",724.857,727.163,2.306,21

who I was. ,808.858,810.145,1.287,21

"that is an amazing thing for me, ",813.96,816.42,2.46,21
because it captures a moment in time every day.,816.444,819.419,2.975,21
I take a picture of myself -- I've been doing this since last year --,819.443,822.703,3.26,21
every single day. ,822.727,824.032,1.305,21
"And, you know, it's the same picture; ",824.056,825.882,1.826,21
it's basically the same person. ,825.906,827.663,1.757,21
Only a couple of people read it. ,827.687,829.266,1.579,21
I don't write this for this audience; ,829.29,831.143,1.853,21

"and they tell me, ""You haven't updated."" ",836.913,839.261,2.348,21
I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated.,839.285,842.245,2.96,21
"But this is amazing, because I can go back to a day -- to April 2005,",842.269,845.834,3.565,21

"I put the bad pictures up too, ",851.998,854.097,2.099,21

And I remember instantly: I am in Germany in this --,857.741,861.401,3.66,21
I had to go for a one-day trip. ,861.425,862.925,1.5,21
"I was sick, and I was in a hotel room, ",862.949,865.613,2.664,21

but it's something that is really important.,878.744,881.169,2.425,21
"And the last story I really want to tell is this story,",881.582,886.97,5.388,21

"She was writing and writing, and we all started reading it,",907.858,910.994,3.136,21
"because we had so few blogs on the service,",911.018,913.085,2.067,21

and it was a very hard day at the company. ,928.34,931.499,3.159,21

"how much blogging affects our relationship,",934.858,937.566,2.708,21

where she was talking about what she was doing.,944.245,947.507,3.262,21

"her sister wrote to me, and she said -- ",951.084,952.97,1.886,21
and she wrote on this blog -- ,952.994,954.398,1.404,21
that writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life,954.422,957.658,3.236,21
"was probably the best thing that had happened to her,",957.682,960.175,2.493,21
"and being able to talk to people and to share what was going on,",960.199,963.267,3.068,21
and being able to write and receive comments.,963.291,966.18,2.889,21

"that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs,",976.045,978.528,2.483,21
"that we can be people who are open, and wanting to help and talk to people.",978.552,982.235,3.683,21
That was an amazing thing. ,982.259,983.834,1.575,21
"And so I printed out and sent a PDF of her blog to her family,",983.858,989.345,5.487,21

"So, this is her legacy, ",997.272,1000.237,2.965,21

"think about blogs, think about what they are,",1003.581,1005.738,2.157,21
"think about what you've thought of them, ",1005.762,1007.69,1.928,21
"and then actually do it, ",1007.714,1008.879,1.165,21

Paul and I had met as first-year medical students at Yale.,35.278,38.774,3.496,2778
He was smart and kind and super funny. ,38.798,42.238,3.44,2778
"He used to keep a gorilla suit in the trunk of his car,",42.838,46.654,3.816,2778

(Laughter) ,49.118,50.318,1.2,2778
I fell in love with Paul as I watched the care he took with his patients.,51.158,54.878,3.72,2778
"He stayed late talking with them, ",55.358,57.534,2.176,2778
seeking to understand the experience of illness,57.558,61.014,3.456,2778
and not just its technicalities. ,61.038,63.158,2.12,2778
He later told me he fell in love with me ,64.518,66.734,2.216,2778
when he saw me cry over an EKG of a heart that had ceased beating.,66.758,71.798,5.04,2778

"but even in the heady days of young love, ",74.638,77.774,3.136,2778
we were learning how to approach suffering together.,77.798,80.918,3.12,2778
We got married and became doctors. ,82.798,85.174,2.376,2778
I was working as an internist ,85.198,87.214,2.016,2778
and Paul was finishing his training as a neurosurgeon,87.238,91.294,4.056,2778
when he started to lose weight. ,91.318,92.958,1.64,2778
He developed excruciating back pain and a cough that wouldn't go away.,94.438,99.358,4.92,2778
"And when he was admitted to the hospital, ",100.358,102.494,2.136,2778
a CT scan revealed tumors in Paul's lungs and in his bones.,102.518,106.598,4.08,2778
We had both cared for patients with devastating diagnoses;,108.598,112.198,3.6,2778
now it was our turn. ,113.158,115.518,2.36,2778
We lived with Paul's illness for 22 months.,118.678,121.278,2.6,2778
He wrote a memoir about facing mortality. ,121.878,124.398,2.52,2778
"I gave birth to our daughter Cady, ",125.278,127.438,2.16,2778
and we loved her and each other. ,128.198,129.878,1.68,2778
We learned directly how to struggle through really tough medical decisions.,130.678,135.318,4.64,2778
The day we took Paul into the hospital for the last time,137.278,140.853,3.575,2778
was the most difficult day of my life. ,140.877,142.918,2.041,2778
When he turned to me at the end ,144.518,146.494,1.976,2778
"and said, ""I'm ready,"" ",146.518,148.998,2.48,2778
I knew that wasn't just a brave decision. ,150.958,153.638,2.68,2778
It was the right one. ,154.238,155.558,1.32,2778
Paul didn't want a ventilator and CPR. ,156.638,159.518,2.88,2778
"In that moment, ",160.318,161.814,1.496,2778
the most important thing to Paul ,161.838,164.438,2.6,2778
was to hold our baby daughter. ,165.518,167.198,1.68,2778
"Nine hours later, ",169.198,171.014,1.816,2778
Paul died. ,171.038,172.238,1.2,2778
I've always thought of myself as a caregiver --,175.918,178.174,2.256,2778
most physicians do -- ,178.198,180.254,2.056,2778
and taking care of Paul deepened what that meant.,180.278,183.078,2.8,2778
"Watching him reshape his identity during his illness,",184.078,187.694,3.616,2778

talking together through his choices -- ,191.238,193.774,2.536,2778
those experiences taught me ,193.798,195.214,1.416,2778
"that resilience does not mean bouncing back to where you were before,",195.238,200.494,5.256,2778
or pretending that the hard stuff isn't hard.,200.518,203.198,2.68,2778
It is so hard. ,204.078,206.078,2,2778
"It's painful, messy stuff. ",207.118,210.398,3.28,2778
But it's the stuff. ,211.278,212.694,1.416,2778
"And I learned that when we approach it together,",212.718,215.958,3.24,2778
we get to decide what success looks like. ,217.078,220.758,3.68,2778
"One of the first things Paul said to me after his diagnosis was,",223.038,226.358,3.32,2778
"""I want you to get remarried."" ",227.318,228.838,1.52,2778

(Laughter) ,233.798,236.334,2.536,2778
It was so shocking ,236.358,238.414,2.056,2778
and heartbreaking ... ,238.438,240.238,1.8,2778
"and generous, ",241.398,242.614,1.216,2778

"Early in Paul's illness, ",250.718,252.414,1.696,2778

"Tasks like making a will, ",257.358,259.654,2.296,2778

tasks that I had always avoided -- ,262.358,264.934,2.576,2778
were not as daunting as they once seemed. ,264.958,267.238,2.28,2778
I realized that completing an advance directive is an act of love --,267.998,272.357,4.359,2778
like a wedding vow. ,273.438,274.998,1.56,2778

But researchers have found ,444.078,445.494,1.416,2778
"that when people better understand the possible outcomes of an illness,",445.518,450.734,5.216,2778
"they have less anxiety, ",450.758,452.278,1.52,2778
greater ability to plan ,453.038,454.798,1.76,2778
and less trauma for their families. ,455.798,458.118,2.32,2778
"Families can struggle with those conversations,",460.758,463.494,2.736,2778

"Most notably, ",470.878,472.078,1.2,2778
whether to have a baby. ,472.998,474.198,1.2,2778
Months to a few years meant Paul was not likely to see her grow up.,476.758,481.718,4.96,2778
But he had a good chance of being there for her birth,482.798,485.294,2.496,2778
and for the beginning of her life. ,485.318,486.958,1.64,2778
I remember asking Paul ,488.598,490.574,1.976,2778
if he thought having to say goodbye to a child,490.598,493.974,3.376,2778
would make dying even more painful. ,493.998,496.518,2.52,2778
And his answer astounded me. ,498.358,500.214,1.856,2778

"""Wouldn't it be great if it did?"" ",501.958,504.198,2.24,2778

"Not in order to spite cancer, ",509.798,512.358,2.56,2778

that living fully means accepting suffering.,515.358,520.518,5.16,2778
Paul's oncologist tailored his chemo ,523.838,526.254,2.416,2778
"so he could continue working as a neurosurgeon,",526.278,529.574,3.296,2778
which initially we thought was totally impossible.,529.598,532.038,2.44,2778
When the cancer advanced ,533.478,534.774,1.296,2778
"and Paul shifted from surgery to writing, ",534.798,537.318,2.52,2778
his palliative care doctor prescribed a stimulant medication,538.158,541.494,3.336,2778
so he could be more focused. ,541.518,543.118,1.6,2778
They asked Paul about his priorities and his worries.,544.558,548.238,3.68,2778
They asked him what trade-offs he was willing to make.,549.038,552.678,3.64,2778
Those conversations are the best way to ensure,554.438,558.574,4.136,2778
that your health care matches your values. ,558.598,562.478,3.88,2778
"Paul joked that it's not like that ""birds and bees"" talk",564.238,566.894,2.656,2778
"you have with your parents, ",566.918,568.254,1.336,2778
"where you all get it over with as quickly as possible,",568.278,570.814,2.536,2778
and then pretend it never happened. ,570.838,572.534,1.696,2778
You revisit the conversation as things change.,572.558,575.454,2.896,2778
You keep saying things out loud. ,575.478,578.398,2.92,2778
I'm forever grateful ,580.358,581.614,1.256,2778
because Paul's clinicians felt ,581.638,584.014,2.376,2778
"that their job wasn't to try to give us answers they didn't have,",584.038,587.134,3.096,2778
"or only to try to fix things for us, ",587.158,590.534,3.376,2778

"I received a dozen bouquets of flowers, ",603.918,606.614,2.696,2778

and she helped him weigh his choices. ,614.598,617.158,2.56,2778
She knew that living means more than just staying alive.,618.478,623.158,4.68,2778
"A few weeks ago, a patient came into my clinic.",625.678,628.574,2.896,2778

"Yeah, I thought, of course it is. ",643.598,645.398,1.8,2778
But many patients don't feel that. ,646.798,649.038,2.24,2778
Compassion and Choices did a study ,650.798,652.934,2.136,2778
where they asked people about their health care preferences.,652.958,656.158,3.2,2778
And a lot of people started their answers with the words,656.718,660.774,4.056,2778
"""Well, if I had a choice ..."" ",660.798,662.238,1.44,2778

"And when I read that ""if,"" ",666.838,668.734,1.896,2778
I understood better ,668.758,670.934,2.176,2778
why one in four people ,670.958,673.814,2.856,2778
"receives excessive or unwanted medical treatment,",673.838,678.694,4.856,2778
or watches a family member receive excessive or unwanted medical treatment.,678.718,683.878,5.16,2778
It's not because doctors don't get it. ,685.558,687.654,2.096,2778
We do. ,687.678,688.878,1.2,2778

"The things is, we deal with them, too. ",695.718,697.558,1.84,2778
Half of critical care nurses and a quarter of ICU doctors,698.678,704.014,5.336,2778
have considered quitting their jobs ,704.038,706.574,2.536,2778

they've provided care that didn't fit with the person's values.,711.518,714.918,3.4,2778
But doctors can't make sure your wishes are respected,717.358,719.854,2.496,2778

"to protect us, ",218.746,220.202,1.456,2780
and we felt that governments actually worked for our betterment.,220.226,223.882,3.656,2780
"Science was simple and logical, ",223.906,225.842,1.936,2780
Apple was still then just a fruit ,225.866,228.186,2.32,2780
"owned by Eve first and then Newton, ",229.266,231.202,1.936,2780
"not by Steve Jobs, until then. ",231.226,233.562,2.336,2780
"And ""Eureka!"" was what you screamed ",233.586,235.282,1.696,2780
when you wanted to run naked on the streets.,235.306,237.506,2.2,2780
"You went wherever life took you for work, ",238.186,241.802,3.616,2780
and people were mostly welcoming of you. ,241.826,243.906,2.08,2780
Migration was a term then ,244.546,246.522,1.976,2780
"still reserved for Siberian cranes, not human beings.",246.546,249.106,2.56,2780
"Most importantly, you were who you were ",249.946,252.802,2.856,2780
and you said what you thought. ,252.826,254.666,1.84,2780
"Then in my late 20s, ",255.346,256.602,1.256,2780
"I shifted to the sprawling metropolis of Mumbai,",256.626,260.362,3.736,2780
"and my framework, ",260.386,261.722,1.336,2780
"like the newly industrialized aspirational humanity,",261.746,265.042,3.296,2780
began to alter. ,265.066,266.266,1.2,2780
"In the urban rush for a new, more embellished survival,",266.906,269.506,2.6,2780
things started to look a little different. ,270.345,272.362,2.017,2780

"faces, races, genders, money-lenders. ",276.106,279.322,3.216,2780
Definitions became more and more fluid. ,279.346,281.466,2.12,2780
Work began to define you at that time ,282.226,284.586,2.36,2780
"in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner, ",285.346,288.002,2.656,2780
"and all the systems started to feel less reliable to me,",288.026,290.882,2.856,2780
almost too thick to hold on ,290.906,294.042,3.136,2780
to the diversity of mankind ,294.066,296.042,1.976,2780
and the human need to progress and grow. ,296.066,298.106,2.04,2780
Ideas were flowing with more freedom and speed.,299.466,302.386,2.92,2780
"And I experienced the miracle of human innovation and cooperation,",303.346,308.682,5.336,2780
"and my own creativity, ",308.706,310.122,1.416,2780
"when supported by the resourcefulness of this collective endeavor,",310.146,314.642,4.496,2780
catapulted me into superstardom. ,314.666,316.506,1.84,2780
"I started to feel that I had arrived, ",317.106,319.522,2.416,2780
"and generally, by the time I was 40, I was really, really flying.",319.546,323.042,3.496,2780
I was all over the place. ,323.066,324.322,1.256,2780
You know? I'd done 50 films by then ,324.346,326.362,2.016,2780
"and 200 songs, ",326.386,327.986,1.6,2780
and I'd been knighted by the Malaysians. ,328.746,331.002,2.256,2780
"I had been given the highest civil honor by the French government,",331.026,334.322,3.296,2780
the title of which for the life of me I can't pronounce even until now.,334.346,337.682,3.336,2780
(Laughter) ,337.706,338.762,1.056,2780
"I'm sorry, France, and thank you, France, for doing that.",338.786,342.202,3.416,2780
"But much bigger than that, I got to meet Angelina Jolie --",342.226,345.562,3.336,2780
(Laughter) ,345.586,348.322,2.736,2780
for two and a half seconds. ,348.346,349.842,1.496,2780
(Laughter) ,349.866,351.162,1.296,2780
And I'm sure she also remembers that encounter somewhere.,351.186,353.882,2.696,2780
"OK, maybe not. ",353.906,355.122,1.216,2780
And I sat next to Hannah Montana on a round dinner table,355.146,358.682,3.536,2780
with her back towards me most of the time. ,358.706,360.746,2.04,2780
"Like I said, I was flying, from Miley to Jolie,",361.546,363.786,2.24,2780
and humanity was soaring with me. ,364.706,367.962,3.256,2780
"We were both pretty much flying off the handle, actually.",367.986,370.666,2.68,2780
And then you all know what happened. ,371.226,372.946,1.72,2780
The internet happened. ,373.466,374.706,1.24,2780
"I was in my late 40s, ",375.706,377.642,1.936,2780
and I started tweeting like a canary in a birdcage,377.666,380.306,2.64,2780
"and assuming that, you know, people who peered into my world",381.226,384.202,2.976,2780
would admire it ,384.226,385.482,1.256,2780
for the miracle I believed it to be. ,385.506,387.602,2.096,2780
But something else awaited me and humanity.,387.626,389.826,2.2,2780
"You know, we had expected an expansion of ideas and dreams",390.706,395.602,4.896,2780
with the enhanced connectivity of the world.,395.626,398.226,2.6,2780
"We had not bargained for the village-like enclosure of thought,",398.986,405.466,6.48,2780
"of judgment, of definition ",406.666,408.682,2.016,2780
that flowed from the same place ,408.706,410.842,2.136,2780
that freedom and revolution was taking place in.,410.866,413.106,2.24,2780
Everything I said took a new meaning. ,414.466,416.228,1.762,2780
"Everything I did -- good, bad, ugly -- ",416.866,418.826,1.96,2780
was there for the world to comment upon and judge.,419.786,423.122,3.336,2780
"As a matter of fact, everything I didn't say or do also",423.146,425.746,2.6,2780
met with the same fate. ,426.546,427.746,1.2,2780
"Four years ago, ",428.666,429.866,1.2,2780
my lovely wife Gauri and me decided to have a third child.,430.906,434.866,3.96,2780
It was claimed on the net ,435.946,437.626,1.68,2780
that he was the love child ,438.746,440.842,2.096,2780
of our first child ,440.866,442.066,1.2,2780

"And yeah, there was a fake video to go with it.",450.946,453.146,2.2,2780

"slowly, reality became virtual and virtual became real,",468.706,472.082,3.376,2780

"that I could not be who I wanted to be or say what I actually thought,",473.786,477.322,3.536,2780
and humanity at this time ,477.346,479.146,1.8,2780
completely identified with me. ,480.266,482.202,1.936,2780
"I think both of us were going through our midlife crisis,",482.226,485.226,3,2780

"and you've seen a bit of me, so I'm quite shameless, I'll show you.",534.105,537.282,3.177,2780
It was called the Lungi dance. ,537.306,538.762,1.456,2780

Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi.,550.706,553.362,2.656,2780
That's it. It became a rage. ,553.386,555.042,1.656,2780

"because the whole world, and whole humanity,",565.226,567.442,2.216,2780
seemed as confused and lost as I was. ,567.466,569.386,1.92,2780
I didn't give up then. ,570.506,571.762,1.256,2780
I even tried to reconstruct my identity on the social media,571.786,574.562,2.776,2780
like everyone else does. ,574.586,575.842,1.256,2780

"people will think I'm with it, ",578.626,580.202,1.576,2780

were extremely confusing acronyms which I didn't understand. You know?,582.826,586.162,3.336,2780
"ROFL, LOL. ",586.186,588.242,2.056,2780

"Lee Sedol is one of the world's greatest Go players,",14.246,18.243,3.997,2781
and he's having what my friends in Silicon Valley call,18.267,21.152,2.885,2781
"a ""Holy Cow"" moment -- ",21.176,22.686,1.51,2781
(Laughter) ,22.71,23.783,1.073,2781
a moment where we realize ,23.807,25.995,2.188,2781
that AI is actually progressing a lot faster than we expected.,26.019,29.315,3.296,2781
So humans have lost on the Go board. What about the real world?,30.112,33.159,3.047,2781
"Well, the real world is much bigger, ",33.183,35.283,2.1,2781
much more complicated than the Go board. ,35.307,37.556,2.249,2781
"It's a lot less visible, ",37.58,39.399,1.819,2781
but it's still a decision problem. ,39.423,41.461,2.038,2781
And if we think about some of the technologies,42.906,45.227,2.321,2781
that are coming down the pike ... ,45.251,47,1.749,2781
"Noriko [Arai] mentioned that reading is not yet happening in machines,",47.696,52.031,4.335,2781
at least with understanding. ,52.055,53.555,1.5,2781
"But that will happen, ",53.579,55.115,1.536,2781
"and when that happens, ",55.139,56.91,1.771,2781
"very soon afterwards, ",56.934,58.121,1.187,2781
machines will have read everything that the human race has ever written.,58.145,62.717,4.572,2781
"And that will enable machines, ",63.808,65.838,2.03,2781
"along with the ability to look further ahead than humans can,",65.862,68.782,2.92,2781
"as we've already seen in Go, ",68.806,70.486,1.68,2781
"if they also have access to more information,",70.51,72.674,2.164,2781
they'll be able to make better decisions in the real world than we can.,72.698,76.966,4.268,2781
So is that a good thing? ,78.75,80.356,1.606,2781
"Well, I hope so. ",81.856,84.088,2.232,2781
"Our entire civilization, everything that we value,",86.652,89.907,3.255,2781
is based on our intelligence. ,89.931,91.999,2.068,2781
"And if we had access to a lot more intelligence,",92.023,95.717,3.694,2781
then there's really no limit to what the human race can do.,95.741,99.043,3.302,2781
"And I think this could be, as some people have described it,",100.623,103.948,3.325,2781
the biggest event in human history. ,103.972,105.988,2.016,2781
"So why are people saying things like this, ",108.623,111.452,2.829,2781
that AI might spell the end of the human race?,111.476,114.352,2.876,2781
Is this a new thing? ,115.396,117.055,1.659,2781
Is it just Elon Musk and Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking?,117.079,121.189,4.11,2781
"Actually, no. This idea has been around for a while.",121.911,125.173,3.262,2781
Here's a quotation: ,125.197,127.159,1.962,2781
"""Even if we could keep the machines in a subservient position,",127.183,131.533,4.35,2781
"for instance, by turning off the power at strategic moments"" --",131.557,134.541,2.984,2781
"and I'll come back to that ""turning off the power"" idea later on --",134.565,137.802,3.237,2781
"""we should, as a species, feel greatly humbled.""",137.826,140.63,2.804,2781
So who said this? This is Alan Turing in 1951.,142.135,145.583,3.448,2781
"Alan Turing, as you know, is the father of computer science",146.258,149.021,2.763,2781
"and in many ways, the father of AI as well.",149.045,152.093,3.048,2781
"So if we think about this problem, ",153.197,155.079,1.882,2781
"the problem of creating something more intelligent than your own species,",155.103,158.89,3.787,2781
"we might call this ""the gorilla problem,"" ",158.914,161.536,2.622,2781
"because gorillas' ancestors did this a few million years ago,",162.303,166.053,3.75,2781
and now we can ask the gorillas: ,166.077,167.822,1.745,2781
Was this a good idea? ,168.71,169.87,1.16,2781
"So here they are having a meeting to discuss whether it was a good idea,",169.894,173.424,3.53,2781
"and after a little while, they conclude, no,",173.448,176.794,3.346,2781
this was a terrible idea. ,176.818,178.163,1.345,2781
Our species is in dire straits. ,178.187,179.969,1.782,2781
"In fact, you can see the existential sadness in their eyes.",180.496,184.759,4.263,2781
(Laughter) ,184.783,186.423,1.64,2781
So this queasy feeling that making something smarter than your own species,186.447,191.287,4.84,2781
is maybe not a good idea -- ,191.311,193.676,2.365,2781
what can we do about that? ,194.446,195.937,1.491,2781
"Well, really nothing, except stop doing AI,",195.961,200.728,4.767,2781
and because of all the benefits that I mentioned,200.752,203.262,2.51,2781
"and because I'm an AI researcher, ",203.286,205.002,1.716,2781
I'm not having that. ,205.026,206.817,1.791,2781
I actually want to be able to keep doing AI.,207.241,209.709,2.468,2781
So we actually need to nail down the problem a bit more.,210.573,213.251,2.678,2781
What exactly is the problem? ,213.275,214.646,1.371,2781
Why is better AI possibly a catastrophe? ,214.67,217.916,3.246,2781
So here's another quotation: ,219.356,220.854,1.498,2781
"""We had better be quite sure that the purpose put into the machine",221.893,225.228,3.335,2781
"is the purpose which we really desire."" ",225.252,227.55,2.298,2781
"This was said by Norbert Wiener in 1960, ",228.24,231.738,3.498,2781
shortly after he watched one of the very early learning systems,231.762,235.764,4.002,2781
learn to play checkers better than its creator.,235.788,238.371,2.583,2781
But this could equally have been said ,240.56,243.243,2.683,2781
by King Midas. ,243.267,244.434,1.167,2781
"King Midas said, ""I want everything I touch to turn to gold,""",245.041,248.175,3.134,2781
and he got exactly what he asked for. ,248.199,250.672,2.473,2781
"That was the purpose that he put into the machine,",250.696,253.447,2.751,2781
"so to speak, ",253.471,254.921,1.45,2781
and then his food and his drink and his relatives turned to gold,254.945,258.389,3.444,2781
and he died in misery and starvation. ,258.413,260.694,2.281,2781
"So we'll call this ""the King Midas problem""",262.402,264.743,2.341,2781
"of stating an objective which is not, in fact,",264.767,268.072,3.305,2781
truly aligned with what we want. ,268.096,270.509,2.413,2781
"In modern terms, we call this ""the value alignment problem.""",270.533,273.786,3.253,2781
Putting in the wrong objective is not the only part of the problem.,277.005,280.49,3.485,2781
There's another part. ,280.514,281.666,1.152,2781
"If you put an objective into a machine, ",282.118,284.061,1.943,2781
"even something as simple as, ""Fetch the coffee,""",284.085,286.533,2.448,2781
"the machine says to itself, ",287.866,289.707,1.841,2781
"""Well, how might I fail to fetch the coffee?",290.691,293.314,2.623,2781
Someone might switch me off. ,293.338,294.918,1.58,2781
"OK, I have to take steps to prevent that. ",295.603,297.99,2.387,2781
I will disable my 'off' switch. ,298.014,299.92,1.906,2781
I will do anything to defend myself against interference,300.492,303.451,2.959,2781
"with this objective that I have been given.""",303.475,306.104,2.629,2781
So this single-minded pursuit ,306.128,308.14,2.012,2781
"in a very defensive mode of an objective that is, in fact,",309.171,312.116,2.945,2781
not aligned with the true objectives of the human race --,312.14,314.954,2.814,2781
that's the problem that we face. ,316.08,317.942,1.862,2781
"And in fact, that's the high-value takeaway from this talk.",318.965,323.732,4.767,2781
"If you want to remember one thing, ",323.756,325.811,2.055,2781
it's that you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.,325.835,328.51,2.675,2781
(Laughter) ,328.534,329.595,1.061,2781
It's very simple. Just remember that. Repeat it to yourself three times a day.,329.619,333.448,3.829,2781
(Laughter) ,333.472,335.293,1.821,2781
"And in fact, this is exactly the plot ",335.317,338.071,2.754,2781
"of ""2001: [A Space Odyssey]"" ",338.095,340.743,2.648,2781
"HAL has an objective, a mission, ",341.184,343.274,2.09,2781
"which is not aligned with the objectives of the humans,",343.298,347.03,3.732,2781
and that leads to this conflict. ,347.054,348.864,1.81,2781
"Now fortunately, HAL is not superintelligent.",349.452,352.421,2.969,2781
"He's pretty smart, but eventually Dave outwits him",352.445,356.032,3.587,2781
and manages to switch him off. ,356.056,357.905,1.849,2781
But we might not be so lucky. ,361.786,363.405,1.619,2781
So what are we going to do? ,368.151,369.743,1.592,2781
I'm trying to redefine AI ,372.329,374.93,2.601,2781
to get away from this classical notion ,374.954,377.015,2.061,2781
of machines that intelligently pursue objectives.,377.039,381.606,4.567,2781
There are three principles involved. ,382.67,384.468,1.798,2781
"The first one is a principle of altruism, if you like,",384.492,387.781,3.289,2781
that the robot's only objective ,387.805,391.067,3.262,2781
"is to maximize the realization of human objectives,",391.091,395.337,4.246,2781
of human values. ,395.361,396.751,1.39,2781
"And by values here I don't mean touchy-feely, goody-goody values.",396.775,400.105,3.33,2781
I just mean whatever it is that the human would prefer,400.129,403.916,3.787,2781
their life to be like. ,403.94,405.283,1.343,2781
And so this actually violates Asimov's law ,407.322,409.631,2.309,2781
that the robot has to protect its own existence.,409.655,411.984,2.329,2781
It has no interest in preserving its existence whatsoever.,412.008,415.731,3.723,2781
"The second law is a law of humility, if you like.",417.378,421.146,3.768,2781
And this turns out to be really important to make robots safe.,421.932,425.675,3.743,2781
It says that the robot does not know ,425.699,428.841,3.142,2781
"what those human values are, ",428.865,430.893,2.028,2781
"so it has to maximize them, but it doesn't know what they are.",430.917,434.095,3.178,2781
And that avoids this problem of single-minded pursuit,435.212,437.838,2.626,2781
of an objective. ,437.862,439.074,1.212,2781
This uncertainty turns out to be crucial. ,439.098,441.27,2.172,2781
"Now, in order to be useful to us, ",441.684,443.323,1.639,2781
it has to have some idea of what we want. ,443.347,446.078,2.731,2781
"It obtains that information primarily by observation of human choices,",447.181,452.608,5.427,2781
so our own choices reveal information ,452.632,455.433,2.801,2781
about what it is that we prefer our lives to be like.,455.457,458.757,3.3,2781
So those are the three principles. ,460.59,462.273,1.683,2781
Let's see how that applies to this question of:,462.297,464.615,2.318,2781
"""Can you switch the machine off?"" as Turing suggested.",464.639,467.428,2.789,2781
So here's a PR2 robot. ,469.031,471.151,2.12,2781
"This is one that we have in our lab, ",471.175,472.996,1.821,2781
"and it has a big red ""off"" switch right on the back.",473.02,475.923,2.903,2781
The question is: Is it going to let you switch it off?,476.499,479.114,2.615,2781
"If we do it the classical way, ",479.138,480.603,1.465,2781
"we give it the objective of, ""Fetch the coffee, I must fetch the coffee,",480.627,484.109,3.482,2781
"I can't fetch the coffee if I'm dead,"" ",484.133,486.713,2.58,2781
"so obviously the PR2 has been listening to my talk,",486.737,490.078,3.341,2781
"and so it says, therefore, ""I must disable my 'off' switch,",490.102,493.855,3.753,2781
and probably taser all the other people in Starbucks,494.934,497.628,2.694,2781
"who might interfere with me."" ",497.652,499.212,1.56,2781
(Laughter) ,499.236,501.298,2.062,2781
"So this seems to be inevitable, right? ",501.322,503.475,2.153,2781
"This kind of failure mode seems to be inevitable,",503.499,505.897,2.398,2781
"and it follows from having a concrete, definite objective.",505.921,509.464,3.543,2781
So what happens if the machine is uncertain about the objective?,510.77,513.914,3.144,2781
"Well, it reasons in a different way. ",513.938,516.065,2.127,2781
"It says, ""OK, the human might switch me off,",516.089,518.513,2.424,2781
but only if I'm doing something wrong. ,519.102,520.968,1.866,2781
"Well, I don't really know what wrong is, ",521.705,524.18,2.475,2781
"but I know that I don't want to do it."" ",524.204,526.248,2.044,2781
So that's the first and second principles right there.,526.272,529.282,3.01,2781
"""So I should let the human switch me off."" ",529.306,532.665,3.359,2781
And in fact you can calculate the incentive that the robot has,533.679,537.635,3.956,2781
"to allow the human to switch it off, ",537.659,540.152,2.493,2781
and it's directly tied to the degree ,540.176,542.09,1.914,2781
of uncertainty about the underlying objective.,542.114,544.86,2.746,2781
"And then when the machine is switched off, ",545.935,548.884,2.949,2781
that third principle comes into play. ,548.908,550.713,1.805,2781
"It learns something about the objectives it should be pursuing,",550.737,553.799,3.062,2781
because it learns that what it did wasn't right.,553.823,556.356,2.533,2781
"In fact, we can, with suitable use of Greek symbols,",556.38,559.95,3.57,2781
"as mathematicians usually do, ",559.974,562.105,2.131,2781
we can actually prove a theorem ,562.129,564.113,1.984,2781
that says that such a robot is provably beneficial to the human.,564.137,567.69,3.553,2781
You are provably better off with a machine that's designed in this way,567.714,571.517,3.803,2781
than without it. ,571.541,572.787,1.246,2781
"So this is a very simple example, but this is the first step",573.195,576.101,2.906,2781
in what we're trying to do with human-compatible AI.,576.125,580.028,3.903,2781
"Now, this third principle, ",582.615,585.872,3.257,2781
I think is the one that you're probably scratching your head over.,585.896,589.008,3.112,2781
"You're probably thinking, ""Well, you know, I behave badly.",589.032,592.271,3.239,2781
I don't want my robot to behave like me. ,592.295,595.224,2.929,2781
I sneak down in the middle of the night and take stuff from the fridge.,595.248,598.682,3.434,2781
"I do this and that."" ",598.706,599.874,1.168,2781
There's all kinds of things you don't want the robot doing.,599.898,602.695,2.797,2781
"But in fact, it doesn't quite work that way.",602.719,604.79,2.071,2781
Just because you behave badly ,604.814,606.969,2.155,2781
doesn't mean the robot is going to copy your behavior.,606.993,609.616,2.623,2781
"It's going to understand your motivations and maybe help you resist them,",609.64,613.55,3.91,2781
if appropriate. ,613.574,614.894,1.32,2781
But it's still difficult. ,616.164,617.628,1.464,2781
"What we're trying to do, in fact, ",618.26,620.805,2.545,2781
is to allow machines to predict for any person and for any possible life,620.829,626.625,5.796,2781
"that they could live, ",626.649,627.81,1.161,2781
and the lives of everybody else: ,627.834,629.431,1.597,2781
Which would they prefer? ,629.455,631.972,2.517,2781
"And there are many, many difficulties involved in doing this;",634.019,636.973,2.954,2781
I don't expect that this is going to get solved very quickly.,636.997,639.929,2.932,2781
"The real difficulties, in fact, are us. ",639.953,642.596,2.643,2781
"As I have already mentioned, we behave badly.",644.107,647.224,3.117,2781
"In fact, some of us are downright nasty. ",647.248,649.569,2.321,2781
"Now the robot, as I said, doesn't have to copy the behavior.",650.389,653.441,3.052,2781
The robot does not have any objective of its own.,653.465,656.256,2.791,2781
It's purely altruistic. ,656.28,658.017,1.737,2781
"And it's not designed just to satisfy the desires of one person, the user,",659.251,664.472,5.221,2781
but in fact it has to respect the preferences of everybody.,664.496,667.634,3.138,2781
"So it can deal with a certain amount of nastiness,",669.221,671.791,2.57,2781
"and it can even understand that your nastiness, for example,",671.815,675.516,3.701,2781
you may take bribes as a passport official ,675.54,678.211,2.671,2781
because you need to feed your family and send your kids to school.,678.235,682.047,3.812,2781
It can understand that; it doesn't mean it's going to steal.,682.071,684.977,2.906,2781
"In fact, it'll just help you send your kids to school.",685.001,687.68,2.679,2781
We are also computationally limited. ,688.934,691.946,3.012,2781
"Lee Sedol is a brilliant Go player, ",691.97,694.475,2.505,2781
but he still lost. ,694.499,695.824,1.325,2781
"So if we look at his actions, he took an action that lost the game.",695.848,700.087,4.239,2781
That doesn't mean he wanted to lose. ,700.111,702.272,2.161,2781
"So to understand his behavior, ",703.298,705.338,2.04,2781
we actually have to invert through a model of human cognition,705.362,709.006,3.644,2781
that includes our computational limitations -- a very complicated model.,709.03,714.007,4.977,2781
But it's still something that we can work on understanding.,714.031,717.024,2.993,2781
"Probably the most difficult part, from my point of view as an AI researcher,",717.834,722.154,4.32,2781
"is the fact that there are lots of us, ",722.178,724.753,2.575,2781
"and so the machine has to somehow trade off, weigh up the preferences",726.252,729.833,3.581,2781
"of many different people, ",729.857,732.082,2.225,2781
and there are different ways to do that. ,732.106,734.012,1.906,2781
"Economists, sociologists, moral philosophers have understood that,",734.036,737.725,3.689,2781
and we are actively looking for collaboration.,737.749,740.204,2.455,2781
Let's have a look and see what happens when you get that wrong.,740.228,743.479,3.251,2781
"So you can have a conversation, for example,",743.503,745.636,2.133,2781

that might be available in a few years' time.,747.628,749.913,2.285,2781
Think of a Siri on steroids. ,749.937,752.461,2.524,2781
"So Siri says, ""Your wife called to remind you about dinner tonight.""",753.585,757.907,4.322,2781

and I'm looking forward to working on them.,844.544,847.059,2.515,2781
There are reasons for optimism. ,847.083,848.926,1.843,2781
"One reason is, ",848.95,850.109,1.159,2781
there is a massive amount of data. ,850.133,852.001,1.868,2781
Because remember -- I said they're going to read everything,852.025,854.819,2.794,2781
the human race has ever written. ,854.843,856.389,1.546,2781
Most of what we write about is human beings doing things,856.413,859.137,2.724,2781
and other people getting upset about it. ,859.161,861.075,1.914,2781
So there's a massive amount of data to learn from.,861.099,863.497,2.398,2781
There's also a very strong economic incentive,863.521,865.757,2.236,2781
to get this right. ,867.289,868.475,1.186,2781
So imagine your domestic robot's at home. ,868.499,870.5,2.001,2781
"You're late from work again and the robot has to feed the kids,",870.524,873.591,3.067,2781

"And the robot hasn't quite learned the human value function properly,",880.807,884.997,4.19,2781
so it doesn't understand ,885.021,886.272,1.251,2781
the sentimental value of the cat outweighs the nutritional value of the cat.,886.296,891.14,4.844,2781
(Laughter) ,891.164,892.259,1.095,2781
So then what happens? ,892.283,894.031,1.748,2781

That one incident would be the end of the domestic robot industry.,900.364,904.887,4.523,2781

long before we reach superintelligent machines.,908.307,911.022,2.715,2781
So to summarize: ,912.086,913.621,1.535,2781
I'm actually trying to change the definition of AI,913.645,916.526,2.881,2781
so that we have provably beneficial machines.,916.55,919.543,2.993,2781

"but that are uncertain about what those objectives are,",925.063,928.179,3.116,2781
and will watch all of us ,928.203,930.201,1.998,2781

is actually better than ignorance ,962.938,964.51,1.572,2781
and still just shifting its own goals and rewriting that programming?,964.534,968.752,4.218,2781
"Stuart Russell: Yes, so we want it to learn more, as I said,",969.65,976.006,6.356,2781

"It'll only become more certain as it becomes more correct,",977.341,982.862,5.521,2781
so the evidence is there ,982.886,984.831,1.945,2781
and it's going to be designed to interpret it correctly.,984.855,987.579,2.724,2781
"It will understand, for example, that books are very biased",987.603,991.559,3.956,2781
in the evidence they contain. ,991.583,993.066,1.483,2781

"So it's a complicated problem, ",998.335,1000.431,2.096,2781

Do you want your five-year-old to be able to switch off the car,1025.035,1028.136,3.101,2781
while it's driving along? ,1028.16,1029.373,1.213,2781
Probably not. ,1029.397,1030.556,1.159,2781
So it needs to understand how rational and sensible the person is.,1030.58,1035.283,4.703,2781
"The more rational the person, ",1035.307,1036.983,1.676,2781
the more willing you are to be switched off.,1037.007,1039.11,2.103,2781
"If the person is completely random or even malicious,",1039.134,1041.677,2.543,2781
then you're less willing to be switched off.,1041.701,1044.213,2.512,2781
"CA: All right. Stuart, can I just say, ",1044.237,1046.103,1.866,2781
"I really, really hope you figure this out for us.",1046.127,1048.441,2.314,2781
Thank you so much for that talk. That was amazing.,1048.465,1050.84,2.375,2781
SR: Thank you. ,1050.864,1052.031,1.167,2781
Do you ever think about how important the oceans are in our daily lives?,13.585,17.918,4.333,2782
The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet. ,19.788,22.534,2.746,2782
They provide half the oxygen we breathe. ,23.148,25.549,2.401,2782
They moderate our climate. ,25.994,27.648,1.654,2782
And they provide jobs and medicine and food,28.013,31.79,3.777,2782
including 20 percent of protein to feed the entire world population.,32.139,37.083,4.944,2782
People used to think that the oceans were so vast,38.289,40.805,2.516,2782
that they wouldn't be affected by human activities.,40.83,43.29,2.46,2782
Well today I'm going to tell you about a serious reality,44.163,47.449,3.286,2782
"that is changing our oceans called ocean acidification,",47.474,52.106,4.632,2782
or the evil twin of climate change. ,52.321,54.686,2.365,2782
Did you know that the oceans have absorbed 25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide,55.858,61.28,5.422,2782
that we have emitted to the atmosphere? ,61.305,63.548,2.243,2782
Now this is just another great service provided by the oceans,63.928,67.566,3.638,2782
since carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases,67.591,70.46,2.869,2782
that's causing climate change. ,70.485,72.241,1.756,2782
But as we keep pumping more and more and more,73.268,77.304,4.036,2782
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere ,77.33,79.822,2.492,2782
more is dissolving into the oceans. ,79.988,82.441,2.453,2782
And this is what's changing our ocean chemistry.,82.761,85.681,2.92,2782
"When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, ",87.308,89.696,2.388,2782
it undergoes a number of chemical reactions.,89.721,91.959,2.238,2782
"Now lucky for you, ",92.378,93.543,1.165,2782
I don't have time to get into the details of the chemistry for today.,93.568,96.853,3.285,2782
"But I'll tell you as more carbon dioxide enters the ocean,",97.346,100.67,3.324,2782
the seawater pH goes down. ,100.695,103.052,2.357,2782
And this basically means that there is an increase in ocean acidity.,103.688,107.655,3.967,2782
And this whole process is called ocean acidification.,108.306,112.428,4.122,2782
And it's happening alongside climate change.,112.862,115.588,2.726,2782
Scientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades.,116.314,120.417,4.103,2782
"This figure is an important time series in Hawaii,",120.956,123.629,2.673,2782
"and the top line shows steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide,",123.654,128.549,4.895,2782
"or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere. ",128.574,131.089,2.515,2782
And this is directly as a result of human activities.,131.2,134.446,3.246,2782
The line underneath shows the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide,135.298,139.329,4.031,2782
that is dissolved in the surface of the ocean,139.354,142.29,2.936,2782
which you can see is increasing at the same rate,142.536,145.495,2.959,2782
as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since measurements began.,145.52,148.694,3.174,2782
The line on the bottom shows then shows the change in chemistry.,148.885,151.892,3.007,2782
"As more carbon dioxide has entered the ocean,",151.917,154.743,2.826,2782
"the seawater pH has gone down, ",154.768,157.014,2.246,2782
which basically means there has been an increase in ocean acidity.,157.509,161.556,4.047,2782
"Now in Ireland, scientists are also monitoring ocean acidification --",163.143,167.213,4.07,2782
scientists at the Marine Institute and NUI Galway.,167.238,170.031,2.793,2782
"And we, too, are seeing acidification at the same rate",170.182,174.331,4.149,2782
as these main ocean time-series sites around the world.,174.356,177.363,3.007,2782
So it's happening right at our doorstep. ,177.824,180.697,2.873,2782
Now I'd like to give you an example of just how we collect our data,181.528,184.686,3.158,2782
to monitor a changing ocean. ,184.711,186.964,2.253,2782
Firstly we collect a lot of our samples in the middle of winter.,187.147,190.202,3.055,2782
"So as you can imagine, in the North Atlantic",190.227,192.366,2.139,2782
we get hit with some seriously stormy conditions --,192.391,194.996,2.605,2782
"so not for any of you who get a little motion sickness,",195.107,197.74,2.633,2782
but we are collecting some very valuable data.,197.765,200.193,2.428,2782
"So we lower this instrument over the side of the ship,",200.55,203.429,2.879,2782
and there are sensors that are mounted on the bottom,203.454,205.89,2.436,2782
"that can tell us information about the surrounding water,",205.915,208.588,2.673,2782
such as temperature or dissolved oxygen.,208.613,211.033,2.42,2782
And then we can collect our seawater samples in these large bottles.,211.408,215.223,3.815,2782
"So we start at the bottom, which can be over four kilometers deep",215.39,218.642,3.252,2782
"just off our continental shelf, ",218.667,220.524,1.857,2782
and we take samples at regular intervals right up to the surface.,220.77,224.436,3.666,2782
"We take the seawater back on the deck, ",224.833,227.094,2.261,2782
and then we can either analyze them on the ship,227.229,229.608,2.379,2782
or back in the laboratory for the different chemicals parameters.,229.633,232.768,3.135,2782
But why should we care? ,233.125,234.411,1.286,2782
How is ocean acidification going to affect all of us?,234.609,239.053,4.444,2782
"Well, here are the worrying facts. ",240.712,243.624,2.912,2782
There has already been an increase in ocean acidity of 26 percent,244.735,250.537,5.802,2782
"since pre-industrial times, which is directly due to human activities.",250.562,254.569,4.007,2782
"Unless we can start slowing down our carbon dioxide emissions,",255.609,259.696,4.087,2782
we're expecting an increase in ocean acidity of 170 percent,259.989,265.926,5.937,2782
by the end of this century. ,266.346,268.695,2.349,2782
I mean this is within our children's lifetime.,269.671,272.004,2.333,2782
This rate of acidification is 10 times faster,273.463,279.081,5.618,2782
than any acidification in our oceans for over 55 million years.,279.106,285.527,6.421,2782
"So our marine life have never, ever experienced",286.018,290.389,4.371,2782
such a fast rate of change before. ,290.414,293.183,2.769,2782
So we literally could not know how they're going to cope.,293.509,297.408,3.899,2782
"Now there was a natural acidification event millions of years ago,",298.993,303.579,4.586,2782
which was much slower than what we're seeing today.,303.604,306.477,2.873,2782
And this coincided with a mass extinction of many marine species.,306.738,311.579,4.841,2782
So is that what we're headed for? ,312.849,314.436,1.587,2782
"Well, maybe. ",315.228,316.378,1.15,2782
Studies are showing some species are actually doing quite well,316.989,320.481,3.492,2782
but many are showing a negative response. ,320.506,323.496,2.99,2782
"One of the big concerns is as ocean acidity increases,",325.044,329.091,4.047,2782
the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater decrease.,329.385,333.639,4.254,2782
Now these ions are basically the building blocks,334.448,337.359,2.911,2782
"for many marine species to make their shells,",337.384,340.185,2.801,2782
"for example crabs or mussels, oysters. ",340.717,345.272,4.555,2782
Another example are corals. ,345.732,347.692,1.96,2782
They also need these carbonate ions in seawater,347.89,351.071,3.181,2782
to make their coral structure in order to build coral reefs.,351.096,355.001,3.905,2782
As ocean acidity increases ,356.325,358.515,2.19,2782
"and the concentration of carbonate ions decrease,",358.737,361.967,3.23,2782
these species first find it more difficult to make their shells.,362.42,366.88,4.46,2782
"And at even even lower levels, they can actually begin to dissolve.",367.189,370.998,3.809,2782
"This here is a pteropod, it's called a sea butterfly.",372.173,375.236,3.063,2782
"And it's an important food source in the ocean for many species,",375.474,378.648,3.174,2782
from krill to salmon right up to whales. ,378.91,382.433,3.523,2782
The shell of the pteropod was placed into seawater,383.346,386.86,3.514,2782
at a pH that we're expecting by the end of this century.,386.885,390.305,3.42,2782
"After only 45 days at this very realistic pH,",391.162,396.654,5.492,2782
you can see the shell has almost completely dissolved.,396.998,401.14,4.142,2782
So ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain --,401.513,405.647,4.134,2782
and right onto our dinner plates. ,405.782,407.893,2.111,2782
I mean who here likes shellfish? Or salmon?,408.432,412.074,3.642,2782
Or many other fish species ,412.64,414.268,1.628,2782
whose food source in the ocean could be affected?,414.293,417.136,2.843,2782
These are cold-water corals. ,418.084,419.931,1.847,2782
"And did you know we actually have cold-water corals in Irish waters,",420.07,423.603,3.533,2782
just off our continental shelf? ,423.628,425.475,1.847,2782
"And they support rich biodiversity, including some very important fisheries.",425.981,430.1,4.119,2782
"It's projected that by the end of this century,",430.814,433.901,3.087,2782
70 percent of all known cold-water corals in the entire ocean,434.184,440.148,5.964,2782
will be surrounded by seawater that is dissolving their coral structure.,440.535,445.229,4.694,2782
The last example I have are these healthy tropical corals.,448.808,452.466,3.658,2782
They were placed in seawater at a pH we're expecting by the year 2100.,453.03,457.778,4.748,2782
"After six months, the coral has almost completely dissolved.",459.442,464.956,5.514,2782
Now coral reefs support ,466.128,468.493,2.365,2782
25 percent of all marine life in the entire ocean.,468.564,475.091,6.527,2782
All marine life. ,475.828,476.978,1.15,2782
So you can see: ocean acidification is a global threat.,478.026,482.351,4.325,2782
I have an eight-month-old baby boy. ,482.996,485.118,2.122,2782
"Unless we start now to slow this down, ",485.938,489.795,3.857,2782
I dread to think what our oceans will look like when he's a grown man.,489.961,494.326,4.365,2782
We will see acidification. ,495.658,497.626,1.968,2782
We have already put too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.,497.788,502.028,4.24,2782
But we can slow this down. ,502.988,505.67,2.682,2782
We can prevent the worst-case scenario. ,506.054,510.43,4.376,2782
The only way of doing that ,510.708,512.892,2.184,2782
is by reducing our carbon dioxide emissions.,512.971,516.275,3.304,2782
"This is important for both you and I, for industry, for governments.",516.968,521.374,4.406,2782
"We need to work together, slow down global warming",521.558,525.329,3.771,2782
slow down ocean acidification ,525.458,527.839,2.381,2782
and help to maintain a healthy ocean and a healthy planet,528.038,532.771,4.733,2782
for our generation and for generations to come.,532.797,536.088,3.291,2782
Let me show you some images ,24.858,25.858,1,36
of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow. ,25.858,28.858,3,36
"So, that's Kibera, the largest squatter community in Nairobi. ",28.858,37.858,9,36
This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park ,38.858,43.858,5,36
"in Bombay, India, what's called Mumbai these days. ",43.858,47.858,4,36
"This is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela ",47.858,51.858,4,36
in Rio de Janeiro. ,51.858,53.858,2,36
"And this is Sultanbelyi, ",53.858,55.858,2,36
which is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul. ,55.858,59.858,4,36
"They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow, ",62.858,64.858,2,36
the new urban world. ,64.858,66.858,2,36
"Now, why do I say that? ",66.858,68.858,2,36
"To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here, ",68.858,71.858,3,36
his name is Julius. ,71.858,73.858,2,36
And I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera. ,73.858,78.858,5,36
"So, I had been there almost three months, ",78.858,81.858,3,36
and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas ,81.858,85.858,4,36
"and Julius was tagging along, and he was bug eyed ",85.858,88.858,3,36
"and at certain points we were walking around, ",88.858,91.858,3,36
"he grabbed my hand for support, ",91.858,93.858,2,36
which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing. ,93.858,96.858,3,36
They're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly. ,96.858,101.858,5,36
"And I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi, ",101.858,107.858,6,36
and he's one of many. ,107.858,111.858,4,36
"So, close to 200,000 people a day ",111.858,115.858,4,36
migrate from the rural to the urban areas. ,115.858,118.858,3,36
"That's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians ",119.858,122.858,3,36
"who talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week, ",122.858,125.858,3,36
"but almost 1.4 million people a week but I'm a journalist, ",125.858,128.858,3,36
"and we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week, ",128.858,132.858,4,36
close to 70 million people a year. ,132.858,135.858,3,36
"And if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute. ",136.858,140.858,4,36
"So, that'll be -- in the 18 minutes that I'm given to talk here, ",140.858,143.858,3,36
between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities. ,143.858,147.858,4,36
And here are the statistics. ,147.858,150.858,3,36
"Today -- a billion squatters, ",150.858,152.858,2,36
one in six people on the planet. ,152.858,154.858,2,36
"2030 -- two billion squatters, ",154.858,157.858,3,36
one in four people on the planet. ,157.858,159.858,2,36
"And the estimate is that in 2050, there'll be three billion squatters, ",159.858,162.858,3,36
better than one in three people on earth. ,162.858,166.858,4,36
"So, these are the cities of the future, and we have to engage them. ",166.858,175.858,9,36
"And I was thinking this morning of the good life, ",175.858,181.858,6,36
"and before I show you the rest of my presentation, ",181.858,183.858,2,36

and I'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can. ,185.858,191.858,6,36

and they could not afford to be late with the money. ,263.858,266.858,3,36
"'In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen ",266.858,268.858,2,36
"and bundle you out. He will confiscate your things,' Armstrong said. ",268.858,272.858,4,36
"'Not one month, one day,' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu, ",272.858,277.858,5,36
"who was cooking ugali, the spongy white cornmeal concoction ",277.858,280.858,3,36
"that is the staple food in the country, cut into the conversation. ",280.858,284.858,4,36
"They called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a person ",284.858,287.858,3,36
who has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz. ,287.858,291.858,4,36
Hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes; ,293.858,296.858,3,36
the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof; ,296.858,299.858,3,36
and we perspired as we ate. ,299.858,301.858,2,36
"""After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie, ",301.858,304.858,3,36
"put on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare. ",304.858,308.858,4,36
Outside a mound of garbage formed the border ,308.858,311.858,3,36
between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata. ,311.858,314.858,3,36
"It was perhaps eight feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide. ",314.858,319.858,5,36
And it was set in a wider watery ooze. ,319.858,323.858,4,36
"As we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash. ",323.858,327.858,4,36
They couldn't have been more than five or six years old. ,327.858,329.858,2,36
"They were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the muck ",329.858,333.858,4,36
sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile. ,333.858,337.858,4,36
"I thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong. ",337.858,341.858,4,36
"Once atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts, ",341.858,345.858,4,36
"squatted, and defecated. ",345.858,347.858,2,36
The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs. ,347.858,351.858,4,36
"When 20 families -- 100 people or so -- share a single latrine, ",351.858,356.858,5,36
a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing. ,356.858,360.858,4,36
But it stood in jarring contrast ,360.858,362.858,2,36
to something Armstrong had said as we were eating -- ,362.858,365.858,3,36
that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood. ,365.858,368.858,3,36
"""For Armstrong, Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions. ",368.858,373.858,5,36
"Instead, the human spirit radiated out ",373.858,376.858,3,36
from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something ,376.858,379.858,3,36
no legal neighborhood could: freedom. ,379.858,382.858,3,36
"'This place is very addictive,' he had said. ",382.858,385.858,3,36
"'It's a simple life, but nobody is restricting you. ",385.858,388.858,3,36
Nobody is controlling what you do. ,388.858,391.858,3,36
"Once you have stayed here, you cannot go back.' ",391.858,394.858,3,36
"He meant back beyond that mountain of trash, ",395.858,397.858,2,36
"back in the legal city, of legal buildings, ",397.858,400.858,3,36
with legal leases and legal rights. ,400.858,403.858,3,36
"'Once you have stayed here,' he said, ",403.858,406.858,3,36
"'you can stay for the rest of your life.'"" ",406.858,409.858,3,36
"So, he has hope, and this is where these communities start. ",410.858,415.858,5,36
"This is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera, ",415.858,420.858,5,36
little more than a stick-and-mud hut next to a garbage heap. ,420.858,424.858,4,36
"This is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay, India. ",425.858,428.858,3,36
This is home improvement: ,428.858,430.858,2,36
putting plastic tarps on your roof. ,430.858,434.858,4,36
"This is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right? ",434.858,438.858,4,36
"We're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs, ",438.858,444.858,6,36
"and plaster over the brick, some color, ",444.858,447.858,3,36
"and this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi, and it's getting even better. ",447.858,452.858,5,36
He's got a fence; he scavenged a door; ,452.858,454.858,2,36
he's got new tile on the roof. ,454.858,457.858,3,36
And then you get Rocinha ,457.858,459.858,2,36
and you can see that it's getting even better. ,459.858,463.858,4,36
The buildings here are multi-story. ,463.858,465.858,2,36
They develop -- you can see on the far right ,465.858,468.858,3,36
"one where it seems to just stack on top of each other, ",468.858,471.858,3,36
"room, after room, after room. ",471.858,473.858,2,36
"And what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories, ",473.858,477.858,4,36
"and they sell their loggia or roof rights, ",477.858,480.858,3,36
"and someone else builds on top of their building, ",480.858,481.858,1,36
"and then that person sells the roof rights, ",481.858,483.858,2,36
and someone else builds on top of their building. ,483.858,485.858,2,36
All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick. ,485.858,489.858,4,36
"And then you get Sultanbelyi, in Turkey, where it's even built ",489.858,493.858,4,36
to a higher level of design. ,493.858,494.858,1,36
"The crud in the front is mattress stuffing, ",494.858,497.858,3,36
and you see that all over Turkey. ,497.858,499.858,2,36
People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs. ,499.858,503.858,4,36
"But the green building, on behind, ",503.858,505.858,2,36
"you can see that the top floor is not occupied, ",505.858,507.858,2,36
so people are building with the possibility of expansion. ,507.858,510.858,3,36
And it's built to a pretty high standard of design. ,510.858,513.858,3,36
"And then you finally get squatter homes like this, ",513.858,515.858,2,36
which is built on the suburban model. ,515.858,517.858,2,36
"Hey, that's a single family home in the squatter community. ",517.858,520.858,3,36
"That's also in Istanbul, Turkey. ",520.858,522.858,2,36
"They're quite vital places, these communities. ",522.858,524.858,2,36
"This is the main drag of Rocinha, the Estrada da Gavea, ",524.858,528.858,4,36
"and there's a bus route that runs through it, ",528.858,530.858,2,36
lots of people out on the street. ,530.858,532.858,2,36
These communities in these cities are actually more vital ,532.858,535.858,3,36
than the illegal communities. ,535.858,537.858,2,36
They have more things going on in them. ,537.858,540.858,3,36
"This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a ""beco"" -- ",540.858,543.858,3,36
these are how you get around the community. ,543.858,545.858,2,36
It's on very steep ground. ,545.858,547.858,2,36
"They're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio, ",547.858,550.858,3,36
and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions. ,550.858,554.858,4,36
"So, that's just a rock in the hillside. ",554.858,556.858,2,36
"And these becos are normally very crowded, ",556.858,560.858,4,36
"and people hump furniture up them, or refrigerators up them, ",560.858,563.858,3,36
all sorts of things. ,563.858,565.858,2,36
Beer is all carried in on your shoulders. ,565.858,567.858,2,36
Beer is a very important thing in Brazil. ,567.858,570.858,3,36
"This is commerce in Kenya, right along the train tracks, ",570.858,575.858,5,36
so close to the train tracks that the merchants ,575.858,577.858,2,36
sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way. ,577.858,580.858,3,36
"This is a marketplace, also in Kenya, Toi Market, ",580.858,583.858,3,36
"lots of dealers, in almost everything you want to buy. ",583.858,587.858,4,36
Those green things in the foreground are mangoes. ,587.858,590.858,3,36
"This is a shopping street in Kibera, ",590.858,592.858,2,36
"and you can see that there's a soda dealer, a health clinic, ",592.858,597.858,5,36
"two beauty salons, a bar, two grocery stores, and a church, and more. ",597.858,602.858,5,36
It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built. ,602.858,607.858,5,36
"This here, on the right-hand side, ",607.858,610.858,3,36
is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning -- ,610.858,613.858,3,36
it's a hotel. ,613.858,615.858,2,36
"And what hotel means, in Kenya and India, is an eating-place. ",615.858,621.858,6,36
"So, that's a restaurant. ",621.858,623.858,2,36
People steal electrical power -- this is Rio. ,623.858,625.858,2,36
"People tap in and they have thieves who are called ""grillos"" or ""crickets,"" ",625.858,632.858,7,36
and they steal the electrical power ,632.858,634.858,2,36
and wire the neighborhood. ,634.858,636.858,2,36
"People burn trash to get rid of the garbage, ",636.858,639.858,3,36
and they dig their own sewer channels. ,639.858,643.858,4,36
Talk about more plastic bags than plankton. ,643.858,646.858,3,36
And sometimes they have natural trash-disposal. ,646.858,650.858,4,36
"And when they have more money they cement their streets, ",650.858,653.858,3,36
"and they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that. ",653.858,657.858,4,36
"This is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place, ",657.858,663.858,6,36
"and that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do: ",663.858,666.858,3,36
they steal electricity; they install a pump ,666.858,668.858,2,36
"and they tap into the water main, and pump water up to their houses. ",668.858,672.858,4,36
"So, the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village, ",672.858,678.858,6,36
"to the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi? ",678.858,683.858,5,36
I say there are two things. ,683.858,685.858,2,36
One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted. ,685.858,687.858,2,36
"That does not necessarily mean property rights, ",687.858,689.858,2,36
"and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question, ",689.858,693.858,4,36
because property rights create a lot of complications. ,693.858,695.858,2,36
"They're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt ",695.858,699.858,4,36
"and have to pay back the debt, ",699.858,701.858,2,36
and sometimes have to sell their property ,701.858,703.858,2,36
in order to pay back the debt. ,703.858,705.858,2,36
There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights ,705.858,707.858,2,36
"sometimes don't work in these cases, ",707.858,709.858,2,36
but they do need security of tenure. ,709.858,711.858,2,36
"And they need access to politics, and that can mean two things. ",711.858,715.858,4,36
"That can mean community organizing from below, ",715.858,719.858,4,36
but it can also mean possibilities from above. ,719.858,722.858,3,36
And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable. ,722.858,727.858,5,36
Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters. ,727.858,729.858,2,36
"One is that -- it's called ""gecekondu"" in Turkish, ",729.858,732.858,3,36
"which means ""built overnight,"" and if you build your house overnight ",732.858,736.858,4,36
"in Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law, ",736.858,740.858,4,36
if they don't catch you during the night. ,740.858,743.858,3,36
"And the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people ",743.858,747.858,4,36
"in the community, you can petition the government ",747.858,749.858,2,36
to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality. ,749.858,753.858,4,36
"And when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics. ",753.858,756.858,3,36
"You're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes, ",756.858,758.858,2,36
"provide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do. ",758.858,762.858,4,36
"So, these are the civic leaders of the future. ",762.858,765.858,3,36
The woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa. ,766.858,767.858,1,36
She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai. ,767.858,773.858,6,36
That's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her family ,773.858,775.858,2,36
on the tent along the same highway median. ,775.858,777.858,2,36
They're very outspoken. They're very active. ,777.858,779.858,2,36
They can be community leaders. ,779.858,781.858,2,36
"This woman is Nine, which means ""grandma"" in Turkish. ",782.858,785.858,3,36
And there were three old ladies who lived in -- ,785.858,787.858,2,36
"that's her self-built house behind her -- and they've lived there for 30 or 40 years, ",787.858,792.858,5,36
and they are the backbone of the community there. ,792.858,795.858,3,36
"This is Richard Muthama Peter, ",795.858,797.858,2,36
and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera. ,797.858,800.858,3,36
"He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood, ",800.858,803.858,3,36
"and the people in the neighborhood, ",803.858,805.858,2,36
and is a great resource in the community. ,805.858,807.858,2,36
"And finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio, ",807.858,811.858,4,36
"the fruit merchant with his two kids here, ",811.858,813.858,2,36
and a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know. ,813.858,818.858,5,36
The future of these communities is in the people ,818.858,820.858,2,36
and in our ability to work with those people. ,820.858,824.858,4,36
"So, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book, ",824.858,828.858,4,36
"from what Armstrong said, and from all these people, ",828.858,830.858,2,36
is that these are neighborhoods. ,830.858,832.858,2,36
The issue is not urban poverty. ,832.858,834.858,2,36
"The issue is not the larger, over-arching thing. ",834.858,837.858,3,36
The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods -- ,837.858,840.858,3,36
this is a legitimate form of urban development -- ,840.858,843.858,3,36
"and that cities have to engage these residents, ",843.858,846.858,3,36
because they are building the cities of the future. ,846.858,849.858,3,36
"I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem. ",24.858,29.858,5,4
We're entering a second generation of no progress ,29.858,33.858,4,4
"in terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed. ",33.858,38.858,5,4
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth ,38.858,44.858,6,4
to go out and continue this very important thing ,44.858,47.858,3,4
that we as a species have always done. ,47.858,49.858,2,4
"And that is, instinctively we've gone out ",49.858,52.858,3,4
"and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places, ",52.858,58.858,6,4
"and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived. ",58.858,64.858,6,4
And I feel very strongly ,64.858,66.858,2,4
that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids ,66.858,70.858,4,4
that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version ,70.858,74.858,4,4
of a cell phone with a video in it. ,74.858,77.858,3,4
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization; ,77.858,81.858,4,4
they need to look forward to breakthroughs. ,81.858,85.858,4,4
"We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us ",85.858,89.858,4,4
and help us survive in the future. ,89.858,92.858,3,4
I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine ,92.858,98.858,6,4
"to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up. ",98.858,104.858,6,4
We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics. ,104.858,109.858,5,4
(Laughter) ,109.858,110.858,1,4
What we're looking forward to is -- ,110.858,113.858,3,4
(Applause) ,113.858,114.858,1,4
what we're looking forward to ,114.858,117.858,3,4
"is not only the inspiration of our children, ",117.858,120.858,3,4
but the current plan right now is not really even allowing ,120.858,125.858,5,4
the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's ,125.858,129.858,4,4
space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff. ,129.858,135.858,6,4
We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later? ,135.858,141.858,6,4
And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new. ,141.858,147.858,6,4
I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's -- ,147.858,151.858,4,4
"the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though, ",151.858,155.858,4,4
is that right back to where we inspire people ,155.858,159.858,4,4
who will be our great leaders later. ,159.858,161.858,2,4
That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here. ,161.858,165.858,4,4
And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young: ,165.858,169.858,4,4
"three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds. ",169.858,173.858,4,4
What they look at is the most important thing. ,173.858,177.858,4,4
Let's take a snapshot at aviation. ,177.858,180.858,3,4
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period ,180.858,183.858,3,4
when marvelous things happened. ,183.858,186.858,3,4
"It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, ",186.858,190.858,4,4
"""Ooh, hey, I can do that."" There's only a few people that have flown ",190.858,194.858,4,4
"in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, ",194.858,199.858,5,4
thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection. ,199.858,203.858,4,4
"Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today, ",203.858,207.858,4,4
but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes. ,207.858,211.858,4,4
"There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried, ",211.858,216.858,5,4
"and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again. ",216.858,220.858,4,4
The ones that flew and landed OK ,220.858,223.858,3,4
because there were no trained pilots ,223.858,224.858,1,4
who had good flying qualities by definition. ,224.858,228.858,4,4
"So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts, ",228.858,233.858,5,4
"in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts ",233.858,236.858,3,4
"of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe, ",236.858,239.858,3,4
as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good. ,239.858,243.858,4,4
That has not happened at all in space flying. ,243.858,245.858,2,4
There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians. ,245.858,249.858,4,4
"Well, who was inspired during that time period? ",249.858,251.858,2,4
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought ,251.858,254.858,3,4
were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation. ,254.858,257.858,3,4
And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them ,257.858,261.858,4,4
was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation. ,261.858,268.858,7,4
"Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too. ",268.858,272.858,4,4
The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there ,272.858,277.858,5,4
showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik. ,277.858,279.858,2,4
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting ,279.858,283.858,4,4
than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there; ,283.858,285.858,2,4
"we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right? ",285.858,289.858,4,4
"But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots ",289.858,292.858,3,4
and they've landed it only in the deserts. ,292.858,295.858,3,4
(Laughter) ,295.858,299.858,4,4
"If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew, ",299.858,306.858,7,4
and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters ,306.858,309.858,3,4
and the blue line is commercial air transport. ,309.858,312.858,3,4
You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid -- ,312.858,314.858,2,4
and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage ,314.858,318.858,4,4
to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try. ,318.858,323.858,5,4
"Well, what did I do when I was a kid? ",323.858,325.858,2,4
I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing ,325.858,328.858,3,4
"and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes. ",328.858,333.858,5,4
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War ,333.858,335.858,2,4
flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force. ,335.858,338.858,3,4
And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes ,338.858,340.858,2,4
that people could build in their garages. ,340.858,343.858,3,4
"And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them ",343.858,346.858,3,4
"is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82, ",346.858,350.858,4,4
which is my company now. ,350.858,352.858,2,4
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982. ,352.858,359.858,7,4
And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart. ,359.858,363.858,4,4
"The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed ",363.858,367.858,4,4
only a dozen years after the first operational jet. ,367.858,371.858,4,4
"Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service. ",371.858,375.858,4,4
We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What? ,375.858,382.858,7,4
"The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, ",382.858,385.858,3,4
"was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon, ",385.858,390.858,5,4
"take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys -- ",390.858,392.858,2,4
that's kind of cool. ,392.858,394.858,2,4
We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72. ,394.858,397.858,3,4
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961. ,397.858,402.858,5,4
"Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy. ",402.858,407.858,5,4
"Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow, ",407.858,412.858,5,4
have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else. ,412.858,416.858,4,4
These things tend to happen every 25 years. ,416.858,419.858,3,4
"40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement ",419.858,423.858,4,4
on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing -- ,423.858,426.858,3,4
"by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel ",426.858,429.858,3,4
is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here. ,429.858,435.858,6,4
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958. ,435.858,443.858,8,4
"Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles ",443.858,446.858,3,4
if the government develops and the government uses it. ,446.858,449.858,3,4
"You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net. ",449.858,453.858,4,4
"Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS. ",453.858,456.858,3,4
"But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, ",456.858,459.858,3,4
all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it. ,459.858,463.858,4,4
Keep that in mind. I put down innovation -- ,463.858,466.858,3,4
I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none. ,466.858,469.858,3,4
"The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space, ",469.858,473.858,4,4
"and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned ",473.858,476.858,3,4
space flights in the world -- the very first year. ,476.858,479.858,3,4
"In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed. ",479.858,488.858,9,4
There were only three or four flights in 2003. ,488.858,490.858,2,4
"In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights ",490.858,497.858,7,4
to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave ,497.858,501.858,4,4
with my little group of a couple dozen people ,501.858,503.858,2,4
"in order to get to a total of five, ",503.858,505.858,2,4
which was the number the same year back in 1961. ,505.858,510.858,5,4
There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing. ,510.858,515.858,5,4
This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne. ,515.858,518.858,3,4
This is a picture here taken from orbit. ,518.858,520.858,2,4
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that. ,520.858,526.858,6,4
"We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough -- ",526.858,530.858,4,4
at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done. ,530.858,534.858,4,4
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage ,534.858,539.858,5,4
to go out and try that as a small company. ,539.858,546.858,7,4
"Well, first of all, what's going to happen next? ",546.858,549.858,3,4
"The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players. ",549.858,553.858,4,4
There's another one announced just last week. ,553.858,556.858,3,4
And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital ,556.858,562.858,6,4
"is, there is not solutions for adequate safety ",562.858,565.858,3,4
to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this -- ,565.858,570.858,5,4
"three governments have been doing this for 45 years, ",570.858,572.858,2,4
and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died. ,572.858,576.858,4,4
That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record. ,576.858,581.858,5,4
"It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020. ",581.858,587.858,6,4
"I can't tell you when this will start, ",587.858,589.858,2,4
because I don't want my competition to know my schedule. ,589.858,592.858,3,4
"But I think once it does, we will find solutions, ",592.858,597.858,5,4
"and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit. ",597.858,600.858,3,4
"And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon ",600.858,603.858,3,4
so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool. ,603.858,607.858,4,4
Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere -- ,607.858,609.858,2,4
you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want. ,609.858,612.858,3,4
"Oh, it's going to be so much fun. ",612.858,614.858,2,4
(Laughter) ,614.858,616.858,2,4
"OK. My critics say, ""Hey, Rutan's just spending ",616.858,620.858,4,4
a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires. ,620.858,625.858,5,4
"What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."" ",625.858,630.858,5,4
"And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, ",630.858,633.858,3,4
"well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978 ",633.858,638.858,5,4
"and I bought it because I could say, ""I got a computer at my house and you don't. ",638.858,644.858,6,4
"'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger."" OK. ",644.858,649.858,5,4
(Laughter) ,649.858,650.858,1,4
"Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer, ",650.858,653.858,3,4
but the home computer was for games. ,653.858,656.858,3,4
For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for. ,656.858,660.858,4,4
"But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry, ",660.858,664.858,4,4
"big development, big improvement and capability and so on, ",664.858,668.858,4,4
and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention. ,668.858,673.858,5,4
And the inventor is in this audience. ,673.858,675.858,2,4
"Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that, ",675.858,679.858,4,4
something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me -- ,679.858,682.858,3,4
"a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research, ",682.858,688.858,6,4
"our communication and, if we let the Google guys ",688.858,692.858,4,4
"think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter) ",692.858,696.858,4,4
And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids ,696.858,699.858,3,4
that we didn't always have computers in our homes. ,699.858,704.858,5,4
So fun is defendable. ,704.858,707.858,3,4
"OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart, ",707.858,712.858,5,4
but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen. ,712.858,715.858,3,4
"And in it also brings up another point, right here. ",715.858,719.858,4,4
There's a group of people that have come forward -- ,719.858,723.858,4,4
and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward ,723.858,726.858,3,4
"were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age, ",726.858,733.858,7,4
"by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, ",733.858,736.858,3,4
right in this time period. ,736.858,738.858,2,4
"Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family, ",738.858,748.858,10,4
"which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, ",748.858,753.858,5,4
"Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack. ",753.858,757.858,4,4
"These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area, ",757.858,763.858,6,4
and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area ,763.858,766.858,3,4
of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very -- ,766.858,770.858,4,4
"areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability, ",770.858,774.858,4,4
and it will lead us into the next really big thing ,774.858,776.858,2,4
and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually ,776.858,780.858,4,4
it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct. ,780.858,784.858,4,4
They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that. ,784.858,790.858,6,4
There were a couple of examples here. ,790.858,792.858,2,4
The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane ,792.858,796.858,4,4
"was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly, ",796.858,801.858,5,4
and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel. ,801.858,806.858,5,4
"It went a whole life cycle without competition, ",806.858,809.858,3,4
took out of service. And we're stuck back here ,809.858,812.858,3,4
with the same kind of capability for military fighters ,812.858,815.858,3,4
and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s. ,815.858,819.858,4,4
But something is out there to inspire our kids now. ,819.858,823.858,4,4
"And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, ",823.858,825.858,2,4
or if you've got a 10-year-old now. ,825.858,826.858,1,4
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here. ,826.858,832.858,6,4
"Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket ",832.858,834.858,2,4
and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance ,834.858,839.858,5,4
military operational airplane. It's never happened before. ,839.858,843.858,4,4
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance ,843.858,848.858,5,4
"has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes; ",848.858,851.858,3,4
why do you need something better? ,851.858,852.858,1,4
But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying ,852.858,855.858,3,4
"sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute, ",855.858,860.858,5,4
"what's happening here, we'll have military fighters ",860.858,863.858,3,4
"with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this. ",863.858,866.858,3,4
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first. ,866.858,870.858,4,4
"OK, I look forward to a new ""capitalist's space race,"" let's call it. ",870.858,876.858,6,4
"You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, ",876.858,880.858,4,4
because we lost the first two milestones. ,880.858,883.858,3,4
We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware ,883.858,887.858,4,4
to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it -- ,887.858,892.858,5,4
you can argue that's not a technical loss. ,892.858,894.858,2,4
"Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss. ",894.858,898.858,4,4
"America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology, ",898.858,905.858,7,4
and that was a very strong thing. ,905.858,907.858,2,4
"And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, ",907.858,912.858,5,4
"not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability. ",912.858,917.858,5,4
"But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it. ",917.858,926.858,9,4
"Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost ",926.858,929.858,3,4
to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already. ,929.858,932.858,3,4
You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- ,932.858,937.858,5,4
can't do it. You can buy it in Russia. ,937.858,942.858,5,4
You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available ,942.858,945.858,3,4
"because a Russian space program is starving, ",945.858,948.858,3,4
and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats. ,948.858,953.858,5,4
It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip ,953.858,960.858,7,4
"to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done. ",960.858,964.858,4,4
"100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon. ",964.858,967.858,3,4
"But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s, ",967.858,970.858,3,4
"when the space race was going on, ",970.858,972.858,2,4
that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do ,972.858,978.858,6,4
to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware? ,978.858,982.858,4,4
"And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought, ",982.858,985.858,3,4
"that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware, ",985.858,989.858,4,4
the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese ,989.858,993.858,4,4
"or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is. ",993.858,997.858,4,4
"But anyway, I think we need to beat them again. ",997.858,1001.858,4,4
"I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, ",1001.858,1008.858,7,4
private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter. ,1008.858,1013.858,5,4
The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde. ,1013.858,1019.858,6,4
"And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service. ",1019.858,1023.858,4,4
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel ,1023.858,1026.858,3,4
when the commercial stuff is offered. ,1026.858,1030.858,4,4
"OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight. ",1030.858,1034.858,4,4
This little thing says here: five times ,1034.858,1036.858,2,4
"what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already ",1036.858,1044.858,8,4
there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion ,1044.858,1048.858,4,4
investment in private space flight that is not government at all -- ,1048.858,1054.858,6,4
"already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it, ",1054.858,1059.858,5,4
"you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that ",1059.858,1062.858,3,4
"being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed ",1062.858,1066.858,4,4
"and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big. ",1066.858,1069.858,3,4
"I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be -- ",1069.858,1074.858,5,4
"and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars ",1074.858,1078.858,4,4

or less -- this is going to be very profitable. ,1082.858,1086.858,4,4
"I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this ",1086.858,1089.858,3,4
will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer ,1089.858,1093.858,4,4
spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work. ,1093.858,1097.858,4,4
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently ,1097.858,1102.858,5,4
"by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it, ",1102.858,1110.858,8,4
"the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars, ",1110.858,1117.858,7,4
will be at a level of about five times as much ,1117.858,1123.858,6,4
as the current NASA budgets for human space flight. ,1123.858,1128.858,5,4
And that is because it's us. It's private industry. ,1128.858,1136.858,8,4
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff -- ,1136.858,1142.858,6,4
"and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA, ",1142.858,1145.858,3,4
never developed an airliner and never ran an airline. ,1145.858,1149.858,4,4
"But NASA is developing the space liner, always has, ",1149.858,1153.858,4,4
"and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it ",1153.858,1160.858,7,4
"because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004, ",1160.858,1166.858,6,4
"when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it, ",1166.858,1171.858,5,4
"can get a start with it, everything changed after that time. ",1171.858,1174.858,3,4
"OK, thank you very much. ",1174.858,1176.858,2,4
"Last summer, I got a call from a woman named Ellie.",12.81,15.983,3.173,45969
And she had heard about the family separations at the southern border,16.007,19.247,3.24,45969
and wanted to know what she could do to help.,19.271,21.773,2.502,45969
She told me the story of her grandfather and his father.,21.797,25.746,3.949,45969

to just keep walking west across Europe. ,34.708,37.068,2.36,45969
And they did. ,37.092,38.251,1.159,45969
"They walked all the way west across Europe,",38.275,40.293,2.018,45969
and they got on a boat and they got to America.,40.317,43.343,3.026,45969
Ellie said that when she heard the stories of the teens,44.117,48.137,4.02,45969
"walking up across Mexico, ",48.161,50.557,2.396,45969
all she could think about was her grandfather and his brother.,50.581,55.182,4.601,45969
"She said that for her, the stories were exactly the same.",55.206,58.894,3.688,45969

But that is not actually why I'm telling you this story.,73.212,76.339,3.127,45969
I'm telling you this story because it made me think,77.26,80.52,3.26,45969

"And one thing I've learned is that, sometimes,",116.877,120.37,3.493,45969
the things that we're told make us safer and stronger,121.187,125.077,3.89,45969
actually don't. ,125.101,126.306,1.205,45969
"And, in fact, some of these policies have the opposite of the intended results",127.22,132.159,4.939,45969
"and in the meantime, cause tremendous and unnecessary suffering.",132.183,137.286,5.103,45969
So why are people showing up at our southern border?,138.529,141.666,3.137,45969
Most of the immigrants and refugees that are coming to our southern border,141.69,145.168,3.478,45969
"are fleeing three countries: Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.",145.192,149.306,4.114,45969
These countries are consistently ranked ,149.91,152.318,2.408,45969
among the most violent countries in the world.,152.342,155.653,3.311,45969
"It's very difficult to be safe in these countries,",155.677,158.044,2.367,45969

And violence against women and girls is pervasive.,162.138,165.115,2.977,45969
People have been fleeing Central America ,165.979,169.249,3.27,45969

"Now, this has been in the news lately, ",194.22,196.386,2.166,45969
so I want you to remember a few things as you see those images.,196.41,199.728,3.318,45969
"One, this is not a historically high level of interceptions at the southern border,",199.752,205.846,6.094,45969
"and, in fact, people are presenting themselves at checkpoints.",205.87,208.981,3.111,45969
"Two, people are showing up with the clothes on their backs;",209.402,214.273,4.871,45969
some of them are literally in flip-flops. ,214.297,216.639,2.342,45969
"And three, we're the most powerful country in the world.",216.663,219.609,2.946,45969
It's not a time to panic. ,220.162,221.766,1.604,45969
It's easy from the safety of the destination country,222.559,225.085,2.526,45969
to think in terms of absolutes: ,225.109,226.98,1.871,45969
"Is it legal, or is it illegal? ",227.004,229.303,2.299,45969
But the people who are wrestling with these questions,229.692,232.195,2.503,45969
and making these decisions about their families,232.219,236.034,3.815,45969
are thinking about very different questions:,236.058,238.622,2.564,45969
How do I keep my daughter safe? ,238.646,240.519,1.873,45969
How do I protect my son? ,241.416,242.858,1.442,45969
"And if you want absolutes, ",244.072,246.332,2.26,45969
it's absolutely legal to seek asylum. ,246.356,249.369,3.013,45969
It is a fundamental right in our own laws and in international law.,249.82,254.707,4.887,45969
"And, in fact -- ",254.731,255.921,1.19,45969
(Applause) ,255.945,262.809,6.864,45969
"it stems from the 1951 Refugee Convention, ",262.833,266.374,3.541,45969
which was the world's response to the Holocaust,266.398,269.47,3.072,45969
and a way for countries to say never again would we return people to countries,269.494,273.304,3.81,45969
where they would harmed or killed. ,273.328,275.532,2.204,45969
There are several ways refugees come to this country.,276.264,278.785,2.521,45969
One is through the US Refugee Admissions Program.,278.809,281.613,2.804,45969
"Through that program, the US identifies and selects refugees abroad",281.637,285.767,4.13,45969
and brings them to the United States. ,285.791,287.847,2.056,45969
"Last year, the US resettled fewer refugees ",288.485,292.127,3.642,45969
than at any time since the program began in 1980.,292.151,295.832,3.681,45969
"And this year, it'll probably be less. ",295.856,297.814,1.958,45969
And this is at a time when we have more refugees in the world,298.758,301.721,2.963,45969
"than at any other time in recorded history,",301.745,303.8,2.055,45969
even since World War II. ,303.824,305.213,1.389,45969
Another way that refugees come to this country is by seeking asylum.,305.978,309.745,3.767,45969
Asylum seekers are people who present themselves at a border,309.769,313.054,3.285,45969
and say that they'll be persecuted if they're sent back home.,313.078,316.382,3.304,45969
An asylum seeker is simply somebody who's going through the process,316.406,319.62,3.214,45969
in the United States ,319.644,320.803,1.159,45969
to prove that they meet the refugee definition.,320.827,323.365,2.538,45969
And it's never been more difficult to seek asylum.,325.365,328.801,3.436,45969
Border guards are telling people when they show up at our borders,328.825,331.903,3.078,45969
"that our country's full, that they simply can't apply.",331.927,334.476,2.549,45969
This is unprecedented and illegal. ,334.5,336.311,1.811,45969
"Under a new program, ",336.786,339.026,2.24,45969
"with the kind of Orwellian title ""Migrant Protection Protocols,""",339.05,343.216,4.166,45969
refugees are told they have to wait in Mexico,344.43,347.086,2.656,45969
"while their cases make their way through the courts in the United States,",347.11,350.588,3.478,45969
and this can take months or years. ,350.612,352.268,1.656,45969
"Meanwhile, they're not safe, ",352.292,354.111,1.819,45969
and they have no access to lawyers. ,354.135,356.158,2.023,45969
"Our country, our government, has detained over 3,000 children,",357.788,362.148,4.36,45969
"separating them from their parents' arms, ",362.172,364.749,2.577,45969
as a deterrent from seeking asylum. ,364.773,366.859,2.086,45969
"Many were toddlers, ",367.681,369.09,1.409,45969
and at least one was a six-year-old blind girl.,369.871,372.515,2.644,45969
And this is still going on. ,372.539,374.02,1.481,45969
We spend billions to detain people in what are virtually prisons,374.77,378.638,3.868,45969
who have committed no crime. ,378.662,380.199,1.537,45969
And family separation has become the hallmark of our immigration system.,382.757,388.188,5.431,45969
That's a far cry from a shining city on a hill or a beacon of hope,388.561,393.619,5.058,45969
or all of the other ways we like to talk about ourselves and our values.,393.643,397.482,3.839,45969
"Migration has always been with us, and it always will be.",398.095,401.343,3.248,45969
"The reasons why people flee -- persecution, war, violence,",401.857,405.536,3.679,45969
climate change ,405.56,407.073,1.513,45969
and the ability now to see on your phone what life is like in other places --,407.097,411.387,4.29,45969
those pressures are only growing. ,411.411,413.227,1.816,45969
But there are ways that we can have policies that reflect our values,414.56,420.237,5.677,45969
"and actually make sense, given the reality in the world.",420.261,423.176,2.915,45969
The first thing we need to do is dial back the toxic rhetoric,423.938,430.021,6.083,45969
that has been the basis of our national debate on this issue for too long.,430.045,434.736,4.691,45969
(Applause) ,435.395,440.509,5.114,45969
"I am not an immigrant or a refugee myself, ",442.66,445.804,3.144,45969
"but I take these attacks personally, because my grandparents were.",445.828,449.828,4,45969
"My great-grandmother Rose didn't see her kids for seven years,",451.169,455.717,4.548,45969
as she tried to bring them from Poland to New York.,455.741,458.203,2.462,45969
She left my grandfather when he was seven,458.227,460.158,1.931,45969
and didn't see him again until he was 14.,460.182,462.203,2.021,45969
"On the other side of my family, ",462.227,463.823,1.596,45969
my grandmother Aliza left Poland in the 1930s,463.847,467.484,3.637,45969
"and left for what was then the British Mandate of Palestine,",467.508,470.381,2.873,45969
and she never saw her family and friends again.,470.405,472.651,2.246,45969
Global cooperation as a response to global migration and displacement,473.699,478.753,5.054,45969
would go a long way towards making migration something that isn't a crisis,478.777,483.262,4.485,45969
"but something that just is, ",483.286,484.639,1.353,45969
and that we deal with as a global community.,484.663,487.211,2.548,45969
Humanitarian aid is also critical. ,488.446,490.851,2.405,45969
The amount of support we provide to countries in Central America,490.875,493.876,3.001,45969
that are sending refugees and migrants ,493.9,496.329,2.429,45969
is a tiny fraction of the amount we spend on enforcement and detention.,496.353,501.548,5.195,45969
And we can absolutely have an asylum system that works.,502.714,506.483,3.769,45969
"For a tiny fraction of the cost of a wall, ",507.418,510.138,2.72,45969
"we could hire more judges, ",510.162,511.543,1.381,45969
make sure asylum seekers have lawyers ,511.567,513.797,2.23,45969
and commit to a humane asylum system. ,513.821,516.342,2.521,45969
(Applause) ,516.913,521.579,4.666,45969
And we could resettle more refugees. ,525.048,527.614,2.566,45969

when there's a law that's worth opposing ,566.002,568.572,2.57,45969

you will never be the same. ,583.807,585.28,1.473,45969
What I loved so much about my call with Ellie,587.278,589.873,2.595,45969
was that she knew in her core that the stories of her grandparents,590.75,594.606,3.856,45969

"A country is strong when it says to the refugee,",637.227,640.504,3.277,45969
"not, ""Go away,"" but, ",640.528,643.725,3.197,45969
"""It's OK, we've got you, you're safe."" ",643.749,646.566,2.817,45969
Thank you. ,647.07,648.233,1.163,45969
(Applause) ,648.257,651.082,2.825,45969
Thanks. ,651.106,652.312,1.206,45969
"In 1969 in July, ",12.791,15.309,2.518,45970
three Americans launched into space. ,15.333,18.267,2.934,45970
"Now, they went to the surface of the moon, ",18.291,20.684,2.393,45970
they famously made the great leap for mankind.,20.708,24.184,3.476,45970
"Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, they walked on the surface,",24.208,27.309,3.101,45970
they planted this flag. ,27.333,28.601,1.268,45970
It's rightly celebrated as a moment that in America we say is a triumph.,28.625,34.059,5.434,45970
We think it was this amazing accomplishment.,34.083,37.059,2.976,45970
"They didn't just leave behind this flag, though.",37.083,39.351,2.268,45970
They also left behind a plaque. ,39.375,40.852,1.477,45970
"This plaque is a beautiful object, ",40.876,42.517,1.641,45970
and one that I want to talk to you a little bit about.,42.541,45.101,2.56,45970
"First, you might notice that there's two globes,",45.125,47.364,2.239,45970
representing all of earth. ,47.388,48.642,1.254,45970
And then there's this beautiful statement: ,48.666,50.684,2.018,45970
"""We came in peace for all mankind."" ",50.708,52.392,1.684,45970
"Now, at first, this is just nice poetic language,",52.416,55.517,3.101,45970
but it's also set in a typeface that's perfect for this moment.,55.541,59.392,3.851,45970
"It seems industrial, it seems engineered. ",59.416,62.601,3.185,45970
It also is the best possible name ,62.625,64.197,1.572,45970
you could come up with for something on the moon: Futura.,64.221,68.017,3.796,45970
"Now, I want to talk to you about fonts, ",68.041,69.899,1.858,45970
and why this typeface is perfect for this moment.,69.923,72.267,2.344,45970
But it's actually more than just ceremonial.,72.291,74.375,2.084,45970
"Now, when all of you arrived here today, ",75.208,77.976,2.768,45970
you actually had to think about fonts. ,78,80.601,2.601,45970
"You might not realize it, ",80.625,81.892,1.267,45970
but you're all unconscious experts on typography.,81.916,84.892,2.976,45970
"Typography is the study of how fonts inhabit our world,",84.916,89.267,4.351,45970
they're the visual language of the words we use.,89.291,93.208,3.917,45970
"Here's the thing that's funny about this, though.",93.958,96.267,2.309,45970
"I know you're probably not like me, you're not a font nerd,",96.291,99.059,2.768,45970
"maybe some of you are, but if you're not, that's alright,",99.083,101.809,2.726,45970
because I might spend hours every day ,101.833,103.809,1.976,45970
"trying to pick the perfect typeface for the perfect project,",103.833,106.643,2.81,45970
"or I might spend thousands of dollars every year,",106.667,108.976,2.309,45970
trying to get ones with the right features.,109,111.059,2.059,45970
"But all of you actually spend hours every day, evaluating fonts.",111.083,114.226,3.143,45970
"If you don't believe me, think about how you got here.",114.25,116.809,2.559,45970
Each of you had to judge by the signs ,116.833,118.601,1.768,45970
"and maybe even on your phone, ",118.625,120.059,1.434,45970
which signals to trust and which to ignore.,120.083,123.559,3.476,45970
You were evaluating fonts. ,123.583,124.851,1.268,45970
"Or maybe when you're just buying a new product,",124.875,127.101,2.226,45970
you have to think about whether something is expensive,127.125,129.649,2.524,45970
or cheap or hard to get or easy to find. ,129.673,133.392,3.719,45970
"And the funny thing about it is, ",133.416,135.017,1.601,45970
"this may not seem extraordinary to you, ",135.041,136.899,1.858,45970
"but the moment you see something out of place,",136.923,139.226,2.303,45970
you recognize it right away. ,139.25,140.601,1.351,45970
(Laughter) ,140.625,143.017,2.392,45970
"The thing I love about typography, ",143.041,144.726,1.685,45970
"and why I love fonts and why I love Futura,",144.75,147.017,2.267,45970
"is that, for me, what I study is everywhere.",147.041,150.892,3.851,45970
"Every street that I walk down, every book that I pick up,",150.916,153.601,2.685,45970
every thing that I read is filled with the thing I love.,153.625,158.767,5.142,45970
"Now, once you understand the history and what happens with typography,",158.791,163.101,4.31,45970
you actually have a history of everything before you.,163.125,166.517,3.392,45970
And this is the typeface Futura. ,166.541,168.767,2.226,45970
"As previously we've discussed, this is modernism in miniature.",168.791,172.184,3.393,45970
This is a way in which modernism infiltrated this country,172.208,174.976,2.768,45970
"and became perhaps the most popular, or promiscuous typeface,",175,178.226,3.226,45970
of the twentieth century. ,178.25,180.226,1.976,45970
"""Less is more,"" right, these are the aphorisms of modernism.",180.25,183.559,3.309,45970
"And in the visual arts, the same thing happened.",183.583,185.851,2.268,45970
"Let's focus on the essentials, focus on the basic shapes,",185.875,188.559,2.684,45970
focus on geometry. ,188.583,189.851,1.268,45970
So Futura actually holds this to its core. ,189.875,192.601,2.726,45970
You might notice that the shapes inherent in Futura,192.625,195.059,2.434,45970
"have circles, squares, triangles. ",195.083,196.809,1.726,45970
"Some of the shapes are all based on circles,",196.833,198.934,2.101,45970
"like the O, D and C, ",198.958,200.226,1.268,45970
or others have this pointed apex of the triangle.,200.25,203.726,3.476,45970
Others just look like they might have been made,203.75,205.976,2.226,45970
with a ruler or a compass. ,206,207.309,1.309,45970
"They feel geometric, they feel mathematic, precise.",207.333,210.017,2.684,45970
"In fact, this whole system carries through with the way",210.041,212.642,2.601,45970
that the typeface was designed. ,212.666,214.184,1.518,45970
"To not look like it was made like other typefaces, to be something new.",214.208,217.559,3.351,45970
"Here it is in the lightweight, the medium weight and the bold weight.",217.583,221.809,4.226,45970
The whole family has different things to commend to it.,221.833,224.809,2.976,45970
"This was a conscious break from the past, ",224.833,226.809,1.976,45970
"something that looked like it was made by a machine, and not by hand.",226.833,230.101,3.268,45970
"When I say not made by hand, this is what I mean.",230.125,232.434,2.309,45970
"This is what we think about maybe, ",232.458,234.101,1.643,45970
when you might create something with a calligraphic brush or a pen.,234.125,237.726,3.601,45970
That there's thicks and thins. ,237.75,239.184,1.434,45970
"And even more traditional typefaces, say like a Garamond,",239.208,242.601,3.393,45970
holds vestiges of this old system ,242.625,244.392,1.767,45970
in which you can see the A where it get little bit thinner at the top,244.416,247.684,3.268,45970
"and thicker down below, ",247.708,248.976,1.268,45970
because it's trying to look like someone had made it by hand.,249,251.892,2.892,45970
"But Futura, in contrast, ",251.916,253.226,1.31,45970
"is designed to look like no one had touched it at all,",253.25,255.809,2.559,45970
"that this was made by a machine, ",255.833,257.392,1.559,45970
"for a machine age, for an industrial age. ",257.416,259.392,1.976,45970
There's actually a sleight of hand here ,259.416,261.476,2.06,45970
"that Paul Renner, the designer who made this in 1927, employed.",261.5,265.226,3.726,45970
If you look at the way in which ,265.25,266.767,1.517,45970
"the circular shape joins with the vertical shaft,",266.791,269.725,2.934,45970
you'll notice that it tapers just every so slightly.,269.749,272.975,3.226,45970
And this is one of hundreds of ways ,272.999,274.726,1.727,45970
"in which this typeface was designed to look geometrically perfect,",274.75,277.892,3.142,45970
even though it's mathematically not. ,277.916,279.684,1.768,45970
And this is what typeface designers do all the time,279.708,282.101,2.393,45970
"to make typefaces work, every day. ",282.125,284.767,2.642,45970
"Now, there were other designers doing this at the same time in Europe and America.",284.791,288.684,3.893,45970
"These are a few other excellent examples from Europe,",288.708,291.226,2.518,45970
"trying to create something new for the new age, a new moment in time.",291.25,294.517,3.267,45970
These are some other ones in Germany ,294.541,296.309,1.768,45970
"that in some ways look very similar to Futura,",296.333,298.517,2.184,45970
maybe with higher waist or lower waist or different proportions.,298.541,301.601,3.06,45970
Then why did Futura take over the world? ,301.625,303.559,1.934,45970
"In this case, if you can read the titles there,",303.583,306.101,2.518,45970
some of these names don't quite roll off the tongue:,306.125,308.892,2.767,45970
"Erbar, Kabel Light, Berthold-Grotesk, Elegant-Grotesk.",308.916,314.267,5.351,45970
"These aren't exactly household names, are they?",314.291,316.517,2.226,45970
"And so when you compare that to Futura, ",316.541,319.226,2.685,45970
you realize that this was a really good choice by the marketing team.,319.25,322.517,3.267,45970
What's amazing about this name -- ,322.541,324.267,1.726,45970
"you know, what's in this name is that this is a name",324.291,326.934,2.643,45970
that actually invokes hope and an idea about the future.,326.958,330.642,3.684,45970
"And this isn't actually the word for future in German,",330.666,333.19,2.524,45970
"it wasn't a German name, ",333.214,334.476,1.262,45970
they actually picked something ,334.5,335.976,1.476,45970
"that would speak to a wider, larger audience, a universal audience.",336,339.184,3.184,45970
And when you compare it to what was being done in America --,339.208,342.059,2.851,45970
these are the typefaces from the same period,342.083,344.184,2.101,45970
"in the United States in the 1920s, ",344.208,345.851,1.643,45970
"bold, brash, braggadocios. ",345.875,347.184,1.309,45970
You almost think of this as exactly like what the stock market looked like,347.208,350.726,3.518,45970
when they were all going nuts in the 1920s.,350.75,352.809,2.059,45970
And you realize that Futura is doing something revolutionary.,352.833,355.726,2.893,45970
I want to step back and talk about an example of the typeface in use.,355.75,359.934,4.184,45970
"So this is a magazine that we all probably know today, ""Vanity Fair.""",359.958,363.226,3.268,45970
"This is what it looked like in 1929, in the summer.",363.25,366.601,3.351,45970
"And in many ways, there's nothing wrong with this design.",366.625,370.017,3.392,45970
This is absolutely typical of the 1920s. ,370.041,372.642,2.601,45970
"There's a photograph of an important person,",372.666,374.767,2.101,45970
"in this case Franklin Roosevelt, then-governor of New York.",374.791,377.601,2.81,45970
"Everything seems centered, everything seems symmetrical.",377.625,380.267,2.642,45970
"There's still a little bit of ornamentation,",380.291,382.392,2.101,45970
so this is still maybe having some vestiges of the painted lady,382.416,385.392,2.976,45970
and not fully modernistic. ,385.416,386.684,1.268,45970
But everything seems kid of solid. ,386.708,388.351,1.643,45970
There's even drop caps to help you get into the text.,388.375,390.892,2.517,45970
"But this all changed very quickly and in October of 1929,",390.916,393.642,2.726,45970
"a Berlin-based designer came and redesigned ""Vanity Fair.""",393.666,396.642,2.976,45970
And this is what it looks like with Futura.,396.666,399.851,3.185,45970
Instead of the governor ,399.875,401.726,1.851,45970
"now we have a photograph of an abstract, beautiful setting,",401.75,404.642,2.892,45970
"in this case, the ocean. ",404.666,406.184,1.518,45970
"Instead of drop caps, there's nothing at all.",406.208,408.434,2.226,45970
And replaced with a centered layout is now asymmetry.,408.458,412.517,4.059,45970
And it gets even more radical the further you enter the magazine.,412.541,415.601,3.06,45970
"In this case, even more dramatic asymmetry.",415.625,417.642,2.017,45970
"In this case, illustrations by Pablo Picasso, moving across the page",417.666,420.934,3.268,45970
and breaking the gutter of the two pages. ,420.958,424.851,3.893,45970
And there's something even more radical. ,424.875,426.809,1.934,45970
"If you look closely at the Futura, you might notice something.",426.833,429.767,2.934,45970
"You might not pick it up at first, ",429.791,431.434,1.643,45970
but there are no capital letters in the title or the captions on this page.,431.458,435.017,3.559,45970
"You might not think that's very radical, ",435.041,436.976,1.935,45970
"but pick up any magazine, any book or go to any website,",437,439.642,2.642,45970
"and I guarantee, you are not going to find it very easily.",439.666,442.434,2.768,45970
This is still a radical idea. ,442.458,444.851,2.393,45970
And why is that radical? ,444.875,446.142,1.267,45970
"When we think about what capital letters denote,",446.166,449.142,2.976,45970
"they denote something important, ",449.166,450.976,1.81,45970
"whether it's our names, or our titles. ",451,453.142,2.142,45970
"Or maybe even just the name of our corporations,",453.166,456.101,2.935,45970
or maybe our trademarks. ,456.125,457.851,1.726,45970
"Actually, in some ways, America's the home of capitalization.",457.875,461.309,3.434,45970
We love putting capitals in everything. ,461.333,463.226,1.893,45970
(Laughter) ,463.25,464.892,1.642,45970
But think about how radical this would be ,464.916,466.892,1.976,45970
to introduce a magazine where you're taking away all the capital letters.,466.916,471.226,4.31,45970
This has maybe had the same political force,471.25,473.309,2.059,45970
that we now argue over things like pronouns in our society today.,473.333,477.059,3.726,45970
"In the 1920s, ",477.083,478.642,1.559,45970
this is just shortly after Soviet Russia had a communist revolution.,478.666,483.291,4.625,45970
"And for them, this actually represented a socialist infiltration into America.",484.208,488.851,4.643,45970
"All lowercase letters meant that this was an egalitarian,",488.875,492.726,3.851,45970
complete lowering of everything into one equal playing field.,492.75,496.767,4.017,45970
Now this is still kind of a radical idea. ,496.791,498.767,1.976,45970
Think about how often you do capitalize something,498.791,501.077,2.286,45970
to have more power or prestige to it. ,501.101,502.892,1.791,45970
So for them to do this was a way in which Futura was using this idea.,502.916,507.101,4.185,45970
"Now, other designers were doing other things with Futura.",507.125,510.309,3.184,45970
"Others brought other ideas of modernism with it,",510.333,512.601,2.268,45970
"whether it was interesting new illustration styles,",512.625,515.017,2.392,45970
or interesting new collage types of illustration.,515.041,517.892,2.851,45970
"Or even just new book covers, ",517.916,519.976,2.06,45970
whether they were from Europe. ,520,522.101,2.101,45970
But here's the funny thing. ,522.125,523.976,1.851,45970
"In the 1920s, if you wanted to use a new typeface,",524,526.351,2.351,45970
you couldn't just go download it onto your computer.,526.375,528.809,2.434,45970
You actually had to have pieces of lead. ,528.833,531.016,2.183,45970
So for Americans who wanted to adopt this ,531.04,533.101,2.061,45970
"and make it part of their own system, ",533.125,535.141,2.016,45970
"something they could use in everyday typography,",535.165,538.017,2.852,45970
"whether in ads or anything else, ",538.041,539.684,1.643,45970
they actually had to have metal type. ,539.708,541.892,2.184,45970
"So being good American capitalists, what did we do?",541.916,544.351,2.435,45970
We made all sorts of copies. ,544.375,545.767,1.392,45970
"Ones that had nothing to do with the name Futura,",545.791,548.101,2.31,45970
"but looked identical to it, ",548.125,549.976,1.851,45970
whether it was Spartan or Tempo. ,550,551.559,1.559,45970
"And in fact, by the time that World War II started,",551.583,554.309,2.726,45970
American corporations were actually trying to boycott Nazi goods.,554.333,557.767,3.434,45970
"But they said, ""Go ahead and use our copies.",557.791,560.267,2.476,45970
"Use 20th Century, use Spartan, use Vogue, use Tempo.",560.291,562.976,2.685,45970
"These are identical to Futura."" ",563,565.309,2.309,45970
"And in fact, for most people, they didn't even learn the new names,",565.333,568.517,3.184,45970
they just still called it all Futura. ,568.541,570.309,1.768,45970
"So America took this typeface in, ",570.333,572.892,2.559,45970
conquered it and made it its own. ,572.916,574.892,1.976,45970
"So by the time World War II finishes, ",574.916,577.809,2.893,45970
"Americans are using this on everything, ",577.833,579.691,1.858,45970
"whether it be catalogs, or atlases, ",579.715,581.934,2.219,45970
"or encyclopedias or charts and graphs, ",581.958,585.267,3.309,45970
"or calendars, or even political material. ",585.291,588.934,3.643,45970
And even the logo for a new expansion football team.,588.958,592.041,3.083,45970
"And in fact, it was used even on some of the most important advertising",593,596.392,3.392,45970
of the 20th century. ,596.416,597.726,1.31,45970
So it's in this context ,597.75,599.059,1.309,45970
that when the US government was picking a typeface,599.083,601.434,2.351,45970
"to use after World War II for new maps and new projects,",601.458,604.078,2.62,45970
they picked Futura. ,604.102,605.351,1.249,45970
"It wasn't an astounding choice, it wasn't a radical choice,",605.375,608.184,2.809,45970
it didn't have anything to do with communism.,608.208,610.351,2.143,45970
"But in this case, it was used on some of the most important maps,",610.375,613.476,3.101,45970
"so this one, an air force map in 1962, ",613.5,615.351,1.851,45970
or used for the maps in Vietnam in '66. ,615.375,617.791,2.416,45970
And so it wasn't a surprise ,618.791,620.101,1.31,45970
"that when astronauts first started the Mercury program,",620.125,623.184,3.059,45970
"such as John Glenn orbiting the earth, ",623.208,625.018,1.81,45970
that charts and maps that he was using were in Futura.,625.042,627.642,2.6,45970
"And in fact, by the time Mercury morphed into Apollo,",627.666,631.684,4.018,45970
it started getting used more and more for more things.,631.708,634.309,2.601,45970
"So in this case for a safety plan, ",634.333,636.976,2.643,45970
"or even starting to get used on instrument panels,",637,639.601,2.601,45970
or navigational aids. ,639.625,641.309,1.684,45970
Or even on diagrams to show how the whole system worked.,641.333,644.476,3.143,45970
"But here's the amazing thing, ",644.5,645.892,1.392,45970
it didn't just get used for papers that they handed out to people.,645.916,649.017,3.101,45970
"It started to get used for an interface, ",649.041,650.976,1.935,45970
for an entire system that helped the astronauts,651,653.226,2.226,45970
know how to use the machine. ,653.25,654.767,1.517,45970
NASA wasn't just one big corporation making everything.,654.791,658.642,3.851,45970
There was hundreds of contractors -- ,658.666,660.517,1.851,45970
"Boeing, IBM, McDonnell Douglas -- ",660.541,662.934,2.393,45970
all making different machines. ,662.958,664.392,1.434,45970
Now imagine if astronauts had to use different typefaces and different systems,664.416,668.101,3.685,45970
for each component they had in the space shuttles.,668.125,671.517,3.392,45970
This would have been impossible to navigate,671.541,673.559,2.018,45970
and there would have been a cognitive overload,673.583,675.726,2.143,45970
every time they had to open up a new system.,675.75,677.851,2.101,45970
"So in this case, Futura being used on the interface",677.875,680.517,2.642,45970
helped them navigate complexity and make it more clear.,680.541,684.017,3.476,45970
"And it wasn't just used on buttons, it was used on labels,",684.041,687.184,3.143,45970
"and it was used on their food rations, ",687.208,689.018,1.81,45970
and it was used on their tool kits. ,689.042,691.226,2.184,45970
It was used on knobs and levers to tell them what to do.,691.25,695.309,4.059,45970
"In fact, maybe even some of the places ",695.333,697.184,1.851,45970
"where they needed to have things that were complex be more simple to them,",697.208,700.685,3.477,45970
"instructions were printed entirely in Futura,",700.709,703.267,2.558,45970
so that they could know what to do with that one moment.,703.291,705.934,2.643,45970
"They didn't have to remember everything in their head,",705.958,708.517,2.559,45970
they could have it out there in the world to see and refer to.,708.541,711.476,2.935,45970
"In this case, Futura helped make that system,",711.5,713.642,2.142,45970
"which was already a very difficult and complex system,",713.666,716.976,3.31,45970
a little less complex. ,717,718.375,1.375,45970
"In fact, the very first or last thing an astronaut might have seen",719.041,722.184,3.143,45970
when they were entering or exiting the spacecraft,722.208,724.517,2.309,45970
would have been in Futura. ,724.541,725.809,1.268,45970
One of my favorite examples of how Futura worked in this way,725.833,728.976,3.143,45970
is actually this camera. ,729,730.309,1.309,45970
This is a Hasselblad that was made by the Swedish company.,730.333,734.559,4.226,45970
"It's a perfectly good camera, some of you might have used one,",734.583,737.517,2.934,45970
it's prized by photographers as a really great camera.,737.541,741.392,3.851,45970
"And you might notice, if you know anything about cameras,",741.416,744.101,2.685,45970
that there's some modifications made to it.,744.125,746.184,2.059,45970
"In this case, there are stickers placed all over the film canisters,",746.208,749.434,3.226,45970
or other parts of the camera here. ,749.458,752.184,2.726,45970
"What this enabled NASA to do, ",752.208,754.267,2.059,45970
was make something really great out of the astronauts.,754.291,757.767,3.476,45970
"They're not photographers, they're not experts in art.",757.791,760.476,2.685,45970
But they could ensure that they would know how to use this camera,760.5,763.642,3.142,45970
because of the labels placed there in Futura.,763.666,765.851,2.185,45970
"So in this case, ",765.875,767.142,1.267,45970
Futura acquired and made sure that they had legitimacy,767.166,770.976,3.81,45970
with the things they were using. ,771,772.601,1.601,45970
In this case to not take off the film before it would expose.,772.625,775.767,3.142,45970
"Which, in this case, we would have never had",775.791,777.892,2.101,45970
some of the amazing photos we had without this label.,777.916,780.434,2.518,45970
"When we see something as decorative as this, a ceremonial patch,",780.458,786.059,5.601,45970
"or something like this plaque on the moon, ",786.083,788.267,2.184,45970
"we realize that Futura was more than just something ceremonial,",788.291,791.392,3.101,45970
something more than something that had just been picked for its design.,791.416,796.059,4.643,45970
"In fact, Futura had authority, ",796.083,798.767,2.684,45970
had legitimacy and had power because of this choice.,798.791,801.267,2.476,45970
There's one other thing I want to talk about in closing.,801.291,804.476,3.185,45970
And that is that Futura tells a story. ,804.5,807.976,3.476,45970
"And this is what I love about typefaces, is that all of them tell stories.",808,812.184,4.184,45970
"And in this case, this typeface tells a very powerful story",812.208,815.017,2.809,45970
"about assimilation, about something being taken into America",815.041,818.434,3.393,45970
and being made part of its culture. ,818.458,820.892,2.434,45970
"And that's one of the best and worst things America does,",820.916,823.642,2.726,45970
is we take things into our culture and we spit them out back again,823.666,826.767,3.101,45970
and claim them our own. ,826.791,828.059,1.268,45970
"And in this case, Futura mirrors exactly what happened with the technology",828.083,831.684,3.601,45970
undergirding the whole system. ,831.708,833.351,1.643,45970
"Futura was a German typeface, taken in, made into an American commodity.",833.375,837.809,4.434,45970
And so were the technologies: ,837.833,839.267,1.434,45970
"the rockets, the scientists all came from Germany as well.",839.291,842.059,2.768,45970
"So in some ways, this German typeface on an American plaque",842.083,845.309,3.226,45970
perfectly mirrors what happened with the technology.,845.333,847.767,2.434,45970
"And in this case, ",847.791,849.059,1.268,45970
"when you think about this story, you realize that typography on the moon",849.083,854.559,5.476,45970
"represents legitimacy, represents authority,",854.583,857.434,2.851,45970
"and this gave them, the astronauts, the power to get to the moon.",857.458,861.142,3.684,45970
Thank you. ,861.166,862.434,1.268,45970
I'm an historian. ,12.513,14.125,1.612,45972
And what I love about being an historian is it gives you perspective.,14.149,18.166,4.017,45972
"Today, I'd like to bring that perspective to education in the United States.",18.645,23.164,4.519,45972
About the only thing people can agree on ,23.68,26.451,2.771,45972
is that the most strategic time for a child to start learning,26.475,30.332,3.857,45972
is early. ,30.356,31.829,1.473,45972
"Over 50 years ago, ",31.853,33.228,1.375,45972
there was a watershed moment in early education in the US,33.252,36.742,3.49,45972
"called ""Head Start."" ",36.766,38.078,1.312,45972
"Now, historians love watersheds ",38.546,40.626,2.08,45972
because it makes it so easy to talk about what came before,40.65,43.857,3.207,45972
and what's happened since. ,43.881,45.606,1.725,45972
"Before Head Start, basically nothing. ",45.63,48.249,2.619,45972
"With Head Start, ",48.821,50.216,1.395,45972
we began to get our nation's most at-risk children ready for school.,50.24,55.453,5.213,45972
"Since Head Start, we've made strides, ",55.477,58.419,2.942,45972
but there are still 2.2 million children in the US,58.443,62.226,3.783,45972
"without access to early learning, ",62.25,64.59,2.34,45972
or more than half of the four-year-olds in the country.,64.614,67.802,3.188,45972
That's a problem. ,68.571,70.213,1.642,45972
But the bigger problem is what we know happens to those children.,70.237,73.717,3.48,45972
At-risk children who reach school without basic skills,74.138,77.608,3.47,45972
"are 25 percent more likely to drop out, ",77.632,80.672,3.04,45972
40 percent more likely to become teen parents,80.696,83.405,2.709,45972
and 60 percent less likely to go to college.,83.429,86.574,3.145,45972
"So if we know how important early education is,",87.236,90.145,2.909,45972
why aren't all children getting it? ,90.169,92.349,2.18,45972
There are barriers that the solutions we've come up with to date,93.032,96.871,3.839,45972
simply can't overcome. ,96.895,98.764,1.869,45972
Geography: think rural and remote. ,99.296,102.056,2.76,45972
Transportation: think working parents everywhere.,102.08,105.978,3.898,45972
Parent choice: no state requires a four-year-old to go to school.,106.002,110.778,4.776,45972
And cost: the average cost for a state to educate a preschooler,110.802,115.898,5.096,45972
is five thousand dollars a year. ,115.922,118.233,2.311,45972
So am I just going to keep talking about problems?,119.632,122.621,2.989,45972
No. ,122.645,123.813,1.168,45972
"Today, I want to tell you about a cost-effective, technology-delivered,",123.837,128.904,5.067,45972
kindergarten-readiness program that can be done in the home.,128.928,133.11,4.182,45972
"It's called UPSTART, ",133.134,134.49,1.356,45972

"Now, I know what you might be thinking: ",139.636,141.593,1.957,45972
here's another person throwing tech at a national problem.,141.617,145.548,3.931,45972
And you'd be partially right. ,146.06,147.707,1.647,45972
"We develop early learning software designed to individualize instruction,",148.06,152.984,4.924,45972
so children can learn at their own pace. ,153.008,155.92,2.912,45972
"To do that, we rely on experts from fields ranging from reading to sociology",155.944,161.262,5.318,45972
"to brain science development to all aspects of early learning,",161.286,165.203,3.917,45972
to tell us what the software should do and look like.,165.227,168.73,3.503,45972
Here's an example. ,168.754,170.042,1.288,45972
"(Video) Zero (sings to the tune of ""Day-O""): Zero!",170.066,172.812,2.746,45972
Zero! ,172.836,175.347,2.511,45972

"Claudia Miner: That is ""The Zero Song."" ",192.459,195.314,2.855,45972
(Laughter) ,195.338,197.033,1.695,45972
And here are Odd Todd and Even Steven to teach you some things about numbers.,197.057,202.514,5.457,45972
"And here are the Word Birds, ",202.538,203.884,1.346,45972
"and they're going to show you when you blend letter sounds together,",203.908,207.317,3.409,45972
you can form words. ,207.341,208.848,1.507,45972
"You can see that instruction is short, colorful and catchy,",209.245,213.212,3.967,45972
designed to capture a child's attention. ,213.236,215.889,2.653,45972
But there's another piece to UPSTART ,216.924,219.083,2.159,45972
that makes it different and more effective.,219.107,221.85,2.743,45972
UPSTART puts parents in charge of their children's education.,221.874,226.174,4.3,45972
"We believe, with the right support, ",226.559,229.137,2.578,45972
all parents can get their children ready for school.,229.161,234.182,5.021,45972
Here's how it works. ,235.01,236.967,1.957,45972
This is the kindergarten readiness checklist from a state.,236.991,240.121,3.13,45972
And almost every state has one. ,240.145,242.421,2.276,45972
"We go to parents wherever they are, ",242.939,245.08,2.141,45972
and we conduct a key in-person group training.,245.104,248.018,2.914,45972
"And we tell them the software can check every reading, math and science box,",248.519,254.147,5.628,45972
"but they're going to be responsible for motor skills and self-help skills,",254.171,258.356,4.185,45972

"Now, we know this is working ",262.708,264.09,1.382,45972
because we have a 90-percent completion rate for the program.,264.114,267.874,3.76,45972
"Last year, that translated into 13,500 children",267.898,272.252,4.354,45972
"""graduating,"" with diplomas, from UPSTART. ",272.276,276.71,4.434,45972
And the results have been amazing. ,277.75,280.216,2.466,45972
We have an external evaluation ,280.24,282.053,1.813,45972
that shows our children have two to three times the learning gains,282.077,288.444,6.367,45972
as children who don't participate in the program.,288.468,291.526,3.058,45972
"We have a random control trial that shows strong evidence of effectiveness,",291.55,295.928,4.378,45972
and we even have a longitudinal study ,295.952,298.106,2.154,45972
"that shows our children's gains last into third and fourth grade,",298.13,301.757,3.627,45972
the highest grades the children had achieved at the time.,301.781,304.649,2.868,45972
Those are academic gains. ,305.149,306.975,1.826,45972
But another study has shown that our children's social emotional gains,306.999,311.452,4.453,45972
are equal to those of children attending public and private preschool.,311.476,315.209,3.733,45972
"The majority of the 60,000 children who have participated in UPSTART to date",316.519,321.053,4.534,45972
have been from Utah. ,321.077,322.839,1.762,45972
But we have replicated our results ,322.863,324.749,1.886,45972
with African-American children in Mississippi --,324.773,327.602,2.829,45972
this is Kingston and his mother; ,327.626,330.213,2.587,45972
with English language learners in Arizona --,330.237,332.88,2.643,45972
this is Daisy and her family; ,332.904,335.276,2.372,45972
with refugee children in Philadelphia -- this is my favorite graduation photo;,335.3,341.008,5.708,45972
and with Native American children ,341.032,343.336,2.304,45972
from some of the most remote parts of the United States.,343.36,346.924,3.564,45972
"This is Cherise, and this is where she lives in Monument Valley.",347.405,351.456,4.051,45972
"Now, there are skeptics about UPSTART. ",352.93,355.916,2.986,45972
Some people don't believe young children should have screen time.,355.94,359.662,3.722,45972
"To them, we say: ",360.152,363.015,2.863,45972
"UPSTART's usage requirement of 15 minutes a day, five days a week,",363.039,367.418,4.379,45972
is well within the hour-a-day recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics,367.442,372.702,5.26,45972
for four-year-olds. ,372.726,373.928,1.202,45972
"Some people believe only site-based preschool can work,",374.459,378.868,4.409,45972
"and to them, we say: site-based preschool is great,",378.892,382.803,3.911,45972
"but if you can't get a child there or if a parent won't send a child there,",382.827,387.831,5.004,45972
"isn't a technology-delivered, results-based option a great alternative?",387.855,393.954,6.099,45972
And we love working with site-based preschools.,393.978,397.006,3.028,45972
"Right now, there are 800 children in Mississippi",397.03,400.006,2.976,45972

and doing UPSTART at night with their families.,402.324,405.537,3.213,45972
Our audacious idea is to take UPSTART across the country --,407.32,411.466,4.146,45972
not to replace anything; ,412.205,415.412,3.207,45972
we want to serve children who otherwise would not have access to early education.,415.436,420.718,5.282,45972
"We have the guts to take on the skeptics, ",421.898,424.376,2.478,45972
"we have the energy to do the work, ",424.4,426.315,1.915,45972
and we have a plan. ,426.339,427.874,1.535,45972
It is the role of the states to educate their children.,428.482,432.373,3.891,45972
So first we will use philanthropy dollars ,432.397,435.037,2.64,45972
to go into a state to pilot the program and get data.,435.061,438.846,3.785,45972
Every state believes it's unique ,439.409,442.035,2.626,45972
and wants to know that the program will work with its children,442.059,446.083,4.024,45972
before investing. ,446.107,447.302,1.195,45972
Then we identify key leaders in the state to help us champion UPSTART,447.832,452.689,4.857,45972
as an option for unserved children. ,452.713,455.692,2.979,45972
"And together, we go to state legislatures ",455.716,459.147,3.431,45972
to transition UPSTART from philanthropy ,459.171,461.651,2.48,45972
to sustainable and scalable state funding. ,461.675,464.795,3.12,45972
That plan has worked -- ,465.441,467.024,1.583,45972
(Applause) ,467.048,469.27,2.222,45972
Thanks. ,469.294,473.291,3.997,45972
Thank you. ,473.315,474.5,1.185,45972
That plan has worked in three states to date:,474.524,478.132,3.608,45972
"Utah, Indiana and South Carolina. ",478.156,480.996,2.84,45972
We've also piloted the program in a number of states,481.02,484.073,3.053,45972
and identified champions. ,484.097,486.25,2.153,45972
"Next, we're moving to states with the greatest geographic barriers",486.274,490.043,3.769,45972
"to work the plan, ",490.067,491.508,1.441,45972
and then on to states that already have early education,491.532,494.89,3.358,45972
but may not be getting great academic results,494.914,497.686,2.772,45972
or great parent buy-in to participate. ,497.71,500.564,2.854,45972
"From there, we go to the states ",500.588,502.346,1.758,45972
"that are going to require the most data and work to convince,",502.37,507.508,5.138,45972
and we'll hope our momentum helps turn the tide there.,507.532,510.975,3.443,45972
"We will serve a quarter of a million children in five years,",510.999,514.082,3.083,45972
and we will ensure that states continue to offer UPSTART to their children.,514.106,518.987,4.881,45972
Here's how you can help: ,520.309,521.954,1.645,45972
"for two thousand dollars, ",522.532,523.863,1.331,45972
"we can provide a child with UPSTART, a computer and internet,",523.887,527.768,3.881,45972
and that child will be part of the pilot ,527.792,530.571,2.779,45972
that makes certain other children get UPSTART in the future.,530.595,533.938,3.343,45972
We also need engaged citizens to go to their government,534.479,537.46,2.981,45972
and say just how easy it can be to get children ready for school.,537.484,543.282,5.798,45972
"You wouldn't be here if you weren't an engaged citizen,",543.625,546.877,3.252,45972
so we're asking for your help. ,546.901,548.827,1.926,45972
"Now, will all of us this make UPSTART a watershed moment in early education?",550.454,556.082,5.628,45972
I believe together we can make it one. ,556.612,559.271,2.659,45972
But I can tell you without a doubt ,559.739,561.733,1.994,45972
that UPSTART is a watershed moment ,561.757,563.912,2.155,45972
in the life of a child who otherwise would not be ready for school.,563.936,568.266,4.33,45972
Thank you. ,568.29,569.456,1.166,45972
We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.,25.04,30.62,5.58,47
"So I'll try and do that, ",30.644,31.834,1.19,47
but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.,31.858,38.354,6.496,47
"And the first one, in fact, is something that has been known",38.378,41.639,3.261,47
"for most of recorded history, ",41.663,44.916,3.253,47
"and that is, that the planet Earth, or the solar system,",44.94,49.717,4.777,47
"or our environment or whatever, ",49.741,52.663,2.922,47
is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution --,52.687,59.105,6.418,47
"or creation, as it used to be thought -- ",59.129,61.938,2.809,47
"and our present existence, and most important, our future survival.",61.962,68.284,6.322,47
"Nowadays, this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.",69.121,73.081,3.96,47
"And the idea there is that outside the spaceship,",73.677,76.367,2.69,47
"the universe is implacably hostile, ",76.391,79.304,2.913,47
"and inside is all we have, all we depend on,",79.328,83.104,3.776,47
"and we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship,",83.128,86.335,3.207,47
we've got nowhere else to go. ,86.359,88.232,1.873,47
"Now, the second thing that everyone already knows",88.256,90.958,2.702,47
"is that, contrary to what was believed for most of human history,",90.982,96.427,5.445,47
"human beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence.",96.451,102.245,5.794,47
"As Stephen Hawking famously said, ",102.269,104.51,2.241,47
we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet,104.534,109.43,4.896,47
"that's in orbit around a typical star, ",109.454,111.74,2.286,47
"which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on.",111.764,115.662,3.898,47
"Now, the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying",116.799,121.64,4.841,47
"that we're at a very untypical place, uniquely suited and so on.",121.664,126.903,5.239,47
And the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.,126.927,129.784,2.857,47
"And, especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by",129.808,134.669,4.861,47
"and to inform your life decisions, ",134.693,136.834,2.141,47
then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.,136.858,142.155,5.297,47
But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.,143.338,148.695,5.357,47
(Laughter) ,148.719,150.1,1.381,47
And they are. ,150.124,151.454,1.33,47
So let me start with the second one: typical.,152.191,158.695,6.504,47
"Well, is this a typical place? ",159.427,162.009,2.582,47
"Well, let's look around, you know, look in a random direction,",162.033,164.998,2.965,47
and we see a wall and chemical scum -- ,165.022,170.611,5.589,47
(Laughter) ,170.635,172.021,1.386,47
and that's not typical of the universe at all.,172.045,176.686,4.641,47
All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction,176.71,180.177,3.467,47
"and look back, ",180.201,181.373,1.172,47
and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all --,181.397,184.682,3.285,47
all you see is a blue planet. ,184.706,186.492,1.786,47
"And if you go further than that, ",186.516,189.135,2.619,47
"you'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on,",189.159,193.448,4.289,47
"but that's still not typical of the universe,",193.472,195.603,2.131,47
because stars come in galaxies. ,195.627,199.01,3.383,47
"And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe,",199.034,203.753,4.719,47
is nowhere near any galaxies. ,203.777,205.834,2.057,47
"So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy,",205.858,210.556,4.698,47
"and look back, ",210.58,211.741,1.161,47
"and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us.",211.765,216.267,4.502,47
"And at this point, we've come 100,000 light-years from here.",217.237,222.618,5.381,47
But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.,223.349,227.834,4.485,47
"To get to a typical place, ",227.858,229.607,1.749,47
"you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that,",229.631,234.148,4.517,47
into intergalactic space. ,234.172,236.252,2.08,47
"And so, what does that look like -- ""typical?""",236.728,239.771,3.043,47
"What does a ""typical"" place in the universe look like?",239.795,242.344,2.549,47
"Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged",242.368,246.378,4.01,47
a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering,246.402,251.595,5.193,47
of the view from intergalactic space. ,251.619,254.944,3.325,47
"Can we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?",254.968,257.812,2.844,47
"Well, not quite, not quite perfect. ",262.898,266.224,3.326,47
"You see, intergalactic space is completely dark, pitch dark.",266.248,272.929,6.681,47
"It's so dark, ",272.953,274.836,1.883,47
"that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you,",274.86,280.548,5.688,47
"and that star were to explode as a supernova,",280.572,283.699,3.127,47
"and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you,",284.672,289.56,4.888,47
you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer.,289.584,292.734,3.15,47
That's how big and how dark the universe is.,293.525,296.62,3.095,47
"And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright,",296.644,301.517,4.873,47
"so brilliant an event, ",301.541,303.986,2.445,47
that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light-years.,304.01,308.14,4.13,47
(Laughter) ,308.164,309.783,1.619,47
"And yet, from intergalactic space, ",309.807,311.722,1.915,47
it's so far away you wouldn't even see it. ,311.746,314.181,2.435,47
It's also very cold out there -- ,314.205,317.218,3.013,47
less than three degrees above absolute zero.,317.242,320.387,3.145,47
And it's very empty. ,320.411,322.269,1.858,47
The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum,322.293,328.251,5.958,47
that our best technology on Earth can currently create.,328.275,331.095,2.82,47
So that's how different a typical place is from this place.,331.503,337.883,6.38,47
And that is how untypical this place is. ,337.907,340.985,3.078,47
So can we have the lights back on please? Thank you.,341.009,344.08,3.071,47
"Now, how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different",346.201,351.462,5.261,47
and so alien from anything we're used to? ,351.486,354.533,3.047,47
"Well, the Earth -- our environment, in the form of us --",354.557,358.033,3.476,47
is creating knowledge. ,358.057,359.973,1.916,47
"Well, what does that mean? ",359.997,361.337,1.34,47
"Well, look out even further than we've just been --",361.361,365.067,3.706,47
"I mean from here, with a telescope -- ",365.091,367.218,2.127,47
"and you'll see things that look like stars, they're called quasars.",367.242,371.445,4.203,47
"""Quasars"" originally meant ""quasi-stellar object,""",371.469,374.593,3.124,47

But they're not stars. ,378.886,380.086,1.2,47

"Billions of years ago and billions of light-years away,",384.438,387.687,3.249,47

towards a supermassive black hole. ,391.858,394.299,2.441,47
And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy,394.323,399.056,4.733,47
of that gravitational collapse ,399.08,400.55,1.47,47
and some of the matter ,400.574,401.834,1.26,47
"back out in the form of tremendous jets, ",401.858,403.957,2.099,47

with the brilliance of -- I think it's a trillion -- suns.,405.839,410.26,4.421,47

the physics of such a jet. ,417.344,419.268,1.924,47
We couldn't survive for an instant in it. ,419.292,421.579,2.287,47

embodying the same mathematical relationships,473.665,476.712,3.047,47
and the same causal structure. ,476.736,479.164,2.428,47
"Now, that is knowledge. ",479.188,481.226,2.038,47
"And if that weren't amazing enough, ",481.916,483.834,1.918,47
the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other,483.858,487.834,3.976,47
is increasing with time. ,487.858,489.941,2.083,47
That is the growth of knowledge. ,489.965,492.438,2.473,47
"So, the laws of physics have this special property,",492.462,495.921,3.459,47
that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be,495.945,500.615,4.67,47
"can, nevertheless, embody the same mathematical and causal structure",500.639,506.422,5.783,47
and to do it more and more so over time. ,506.446,509.268,2.822,47
So we are a chemical scum that is different.,509.926,513.201,3.275,47
This chemical scum has universality. ,513.225,516.714,3.489,47
"Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision,",516.738,521.193,4.455,47
the structure of everything. ,521.217,522.56,1.343,47
"This place, and not other places in the universe,",522.584,526.351,3.767,47

of the whole of the rest of physical reality.,532.412,535.149,2.737,47
"And so, far from being insignificant, ",535.173,537.021,1.848,47
the fact that the laws of physics allow this,537.045,539.816,2.771,47
or even mandate that this can happen ,539.84,543.341,3.501,47
is one of the most important things about the physical world.,543.365,547.34,3.975,47
"Now, how does the solar system -- our environment, in the form of us --",548.289,553.556,5.267,47
acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe?,553.58,556.906,3.326,47
"Well, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark --",556.93,561.748,4.818,47
"I mean, it is true, but it's the wrong emphasis --",561.772,565.798,4.026,47
"one thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics,",565.822,571.76,5.938,47
"there's no special dispensation, no miracles involved.",571.784,574.775,2.991,47
It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance.,574.799,578.944,4.145,47
"One of them is matter, ",578.968,580.579,1.611,47
because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing.,580.603,585.588,4.985,47
"Information processing is computation, computation requires a computer,",585.612,589.549,3.937,47
and there's no known way of making a computer without matter.,589.573,592.572,2.999,47
"We also need energy to make the computer, and most important,",592.596,596.071,3.475,47
"to make the media, in effect, onto which we record",596.095,600.065,3.97,47
the knowledge that we discover. ,600.089,601.834,1.745,47
"And then thirdly, less tangible but just as essential",601.858,605.999,4.141,47
"for the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations,",606.023,610.331,4.308,47
is evidence. ,610.355,613.332,2.977,47

about 300 years ago. ,622.858,624.636,1.778,47
But the evidence that we used to do that ,624.66,627.95,3.29,47
was falling down on every square meter of the Earth,627.974,631.263,3.289,47
"for billions of years before that, ",631.287,632.94,1.653,47
and we'll continue to fall for billions of years afterwards.,632.964,636.781,3.817,47

"As far as we know, ",639.953,641.887,1.934,47
evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences,641.911,646.066,4.155,47
"is here just for the taking, on our planet.",646.09,649.132,3.042,47
Our location is saturated with evidence ,649.156,652.02,2.864,47

"Out in intergalactic space, ",654.5,656.738,2.238,47
those three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge,656.762,660.151,3.389,47
are at their lowest possible supply -- ,660.175,662.595,2.42,47
"as I said, it's empty, it's cold and it's dark out there.",662.619,666.211,3.592,47
Or is it? ,667.386,668.536,1.15,47
"Now actually, that's just another parochial misconception.",669.148,672.971,3.823,47
(Laughter) ,672.995,674.071,1.076,47
"Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space,",674.095,679.029,4.934,47
"the same size as our home, the solar system.",679.053,682.583,3.53,47
"Now, that cube is very empty by human standards,",682.607,685.949,3.342,47
but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.,685.973,690.834,4.861,47
"And a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station,",690.858,695.95,5.092,47
on which there's a colony of scientists ,695.974,698.208,2.234,47
"that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge, and so on.",698.232,702.268,4.036,47
"Now, it's way beyond present technology ",702.657,704.857,2.2,47
to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space,704.881,708.892,4.011,47
and form it into other elements and so on. ,708.916,712.094,3.178,47
"But the thing is, in a comprehensible universe,",712.73,715.658,2.928,47
"if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics,",715.682,719.048,3.366,47
"then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how?",719.072,723.217,4.145,47
"In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.",723.241,726.913,3.672,47
"If we could do that, we'd automatically have an energy supply,",726.937,730.253,3.316,47
because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor.,730.277,733.807,3.53,47
And evidence? ,733.831,735.482,1.651,47
"Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses,",735.506,738.681,3.175,47

"even one of present-day design, ",740.848,742.991,2.143,47

"you'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies,",749.825,752.677,2.852,47
you'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics.,752.701,755.981,3.28,47
"And locally there, you could build particle accelerators",756.005,758.705,2.7,47
"and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry, and so on.",758.729,762.001,3.272,47
Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips --,762.025,766.388,4.363,47
(Laughter) ,766.412,767.729,1.317,47
because it would take several hundred million years,767.753,770.772,3.019,47
to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back.,770.796,774.106,3.31,47
"But I have to tell you -- and sorry, Richard --",774.13,776.341,2.211,47
but I never did like biology field trips much --,776.365,779.699,3.334,47
(Laughter) ,779.723,781.031,1.308,47
and I think we can just about make do ,781.055,783.051,1.996,47
with one every few hundred million years. ,783.075,785.175,2.1,47

"So, in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites",787.24,794.196,6.956,47
for the open-ended creation of knowledge. ,794.22,796.6,2.38,47
Any such cube anywhere in the universe ,797.215,800.284,3.069,47
"could become the same kind of hub that we are,",800.308,804.893,4.585,47
if the knowledge of how to do so were present there.,804.917,809.767,4.85,47
"So, we're not in a uniquely hospitable place.",810.616,814.09,3.474,47
If intergalactic space is capable of creating,814.114,816.542,2.428,47
"an open-ended stream of explanations, ",816.566,819.152,2.586,47
"then so is almost every other environment, ",819.176,821.343,2.167,47
so is the Earth. ,821.367,822.597,1.23,47
So is a polluted Earth. ,822.621,824.951,2.33,47
"And the limiting factor, there and here, ",825.379,829.126,3.747,47
is not resources -- because they're plentiful --,829.15,831.924,2.774,47
"but knowledge, which is scarce. ",831.948,834.098,2.15,47
"Now, this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and, I think, ought to --",834.537,840.438,5.901,47
make us feel very special. ,840.462,842.87,2.408,47
"But it should also make us feel vulnerable,",842.894,845.419,2.525,47
because it means that without the specific knowledge,845.443,848.858,3.415,47
"that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe,",848.882,852.629,3.747,47
we won't survive them. ,852.653,853.834,1.181,47
"All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light-years away,",853.858,857.406,3.548,47
and we'll all be dead! ,857.43,859.088,1.658,47
Martin Rees has recently written a book ,859.112,861.511,2.399,47
"about our vulnerability to all sorts of things,",861.535,864.834,3.299,47
"from astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong,",864.858,868.834,3.976,47
"and most importantly, to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.",868.858,873.293,4.435,47
And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance,873.317,876.659,3.342,47
of surviving this century. ,876.683,878.11,1.427,47
I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference.,878.134,881.269,3.135,47
"Now, I don't think that probability is the right category",881.293,886.441,5.148,47
"to discuss this issue in, ",886.465,887.834,1.369,47
but I do agree with him about this: ,887.858,889.593,1.735,47
we can survive and we can fail to survive. ,889.617,893.782,4.165,47
"But it depends, not on chance, ",894.423,897.179,2.756,47
but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.,897.203,900.834,3.631,47
The danger is not at all unprecedented. ,900.858,903.66,2.802,47
Species go extinct all the time. ,903.684,906.905,3.221,47
Civilizations end. ,906.929,909.184,2.255,47
The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations,909.208,912.547,3.339,47
that have ever existed ,912.571,913.855,1.284,47
are now history. ,913.879,915.156,1.277,47
"And if we want to be the exception to that,",915.18,918.054,2.874,47
"then logically, our only hope is to make use of the one feature",918.078,923.977,5.899,47
"that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others,",924.001,928.625,4.624,47
"namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics,",928.649,933.096,4.447,47
"our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge --",933.12,937.593,4.473,47
to be a hub of existence. ,937.617,940.388,2.771,47
"So let me now apply this to a current controversy,",940.777,944.497,3.72,47
"not because I want to advocate any particular solution,",944.521,947.736,3.215,47
but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean.,947.76,950.394,2.634,47
And the controversy is global warming. ,950.418,952.834,2.416,47
"Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist.",952.858,955.863,3.005,47
"In regard to global warming, I'm just a layman.",955.887,959.674,3.787,47
And the rational thing for a layman to do ,959.698,962.476,2.778,47
is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory.,962.5,967.001,4.501,47
"And according to that theory, it's already too late to avoid a disaster,",967.025,971.692,4.667,47
"because, if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions",971.716,977.546,5.83,47
"with something like the Kyoto Protocol, ",977.57,979.467,1.897,47
with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost,979.491,983.219,3.728,47
"of hundreds of billions of dollars, or whatever it is,",983.243,985.834,2.591,47
then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.,985.858,990.915,5.057,47
"And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem,",991.299,996.309,5.01,47
merely to postpone it by a little. ,996.333,998.713,2.38,47
"So it's already too late to avoid it, ",998.737,1000.522,1.785,47
and it probably has been too late to avoid it,1000.546,1003.43,2.884,47
ever since before anyone realized the danger.,1003.454,1007.275,3.821,47
"It was probably already too late in the 1970s,",1007.299,1010.363,3.064,47
when the best available scientific theory was telling us,1010.387,1013.582,3.195,47
"that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age,",1013.606,1017.222,3.616,47
in which billions would die. ,1017.246,1019.364,2.118,47
"Now, the lesson of that seems clear to me, ",1020.17,1022.329,2.159,47
and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate.,1022.353,1025.94,3.587,47
It is that we can't always know. ,1025.964,1029.27,3.306,47
When we know of an impending disaster ,1029.294,1031.987,2.693,47
"and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself,",1032.011,1036.554,4.543,47
"then there's not going to be much argument, really.",1036.578,1039.564,2.986,47
But no precautions and no precautionary principle,1039.588,1044.103,4.515,47
can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.,1044.127,1048.269,4.142,47
"Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, ",1048.927,1053.356,4.429,47
not just problem-avoidance. ,1053.38,1055.981,2.601,47
"And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure,",1056.57,1059.954,3.384,47
but that's only if we know what to prevent.,1059.978,1062.906,2.928,47
"If you've been punched on the nose, ",1062.93,1064.891,1.961,47

"If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only,",1070.552,1076.01,5.458,47
then it would achieve very little of either.,1076.034,1078.605,2.571,47
The world is buzzing at the moment ,1078.629,1080.654,2.025,47
with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs.,1080.678,1085.475,4.797,47
It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature,1085.856,1090.087,4.231,47

"and not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply.",1093.222,1096.366,3.144,47
"And some such plans exist, ",1096.39,1097.717,1.327,47
things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away,1097.741,1102.379,4.638,47

the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely --,1117.734,1123.812,6.078,47
"is our only hope, not just of solving problems,",1123.836,1126.629,2.793,47

"which is that if I've learned anything over the last year, ",27.858,29.858,2,73
it's that the supreme irony ,29.858,31.858,2,73
of publishing a book about slowness ,31.858,33.858,2,73
is that you have to go around promoting it really fast. ,33.858,35.858,2,73
I seem to spend most of my time these days ,36.858,38.858,2,73
"zipping from city to city, studio to studio, ",38.858,41.858,3,73
"interview to interview, ",41.858,43.858,2,73

"Because that's kind of the world that we live in now, ",60.858,62.858,2,73
a world stuck in fast-forward. ,62.858,65.858,3,73
"A world obsessed with speed, ",65.858,67.858,2,73
"with doing everything faster, with cramming more and more ",67.858,70.858,3,73
into less and less time. ,70.858,72.858,2,73
Every moment of the day feels like ,72.858,74.858,2,73
a race against the clock. ,74.858,76.858,2,73
"To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is ",76.858,78.858,2,73
in my bio there; I'll just toss it out again -- ,78.858,80.858,2,73
"""These days even instant gratification takes too long."" (Laughter) ",80.858,83.858,3,73
And ,83.858,85.858,2,73
"if you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do? ",85.858,87.858,2,73
"No, we speed them up, don't we? So we used to dial; now we speed dial. ",87.858,90.858,3,73
We used to read; now we speed read. We used to walk; now we speed walk. ,90.858,93.858,3,73
"And of course, we used to date and now we speed date. ",93.858,96.858,3,73
And even things that are by their very nature slow -- ,96.858,99.858,3,73
we try and speed them up too. ,99.858,102.858,3,73
"So I was in New York recently, and I walked past a gym ",102.858,104.858,2,73
"that had an advertisement in the window for a new course, a new evening course. ",104.858,106.858,2,73
"And it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga. ",107.858,110.858,3,73
So this -- the perfect solution for time-starved professionals ,110.858,113.858,3,73
"who want to, you know, salute the sun, ",113.858,115.858,2,73
but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it. ,115.858,117.858,2,73
"I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples, ",118.858,120.858,2,73
and they're amusing and good to laugh at. ,120.858,122.858,2,73
"But there's a very serious point, ",122.858,124.858,2,73
"and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life, ",124.858,127.858,3,73
we often lose sight of the damage ,127.858,130.858,3,73
that this roadrunner form of living does to us. ,130.858,133.858,3,73
We're so marinated in the culture of speed ,133.858,136.858,3,73
that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes ,136.858,138.858,2,73
on every aspect of our lives -- ,138.858,140.858,2,73
"on our health, our diet, our work, ",140.858,142.858,2,73
"our relationships, the environment and our community. ",142.858,145.858,3,73
And sometimes it takes ,145.858,147.858,2,73
"a wake-up call, doesn't it, ",147.858,149.858,2,73
"to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives, ",149.858,152.858,3,73
instead of actually living them; that we're ,152.858,154.858,2,73
"living the fast life, instead of the good life. ",154.858,156.858,2,73
"And I think for many people, that wake-up call ",156.858,158.858,2,73
takes the form of an illness. ,158.858,160.858,2,73
"You know, a burnout, or eventually the body says, ",160.858,163.858,3,73
"""I can't take it anymore,"" and throws in the towel. ",163.858,165.858,2,73
Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke ,165.858,167.858,2,73
"because we haven't had the time, or the patience, ",167.858,169.858,2,73
"or the tranquility, ",169.858,171.858,2,73
"to be with the other person, to listen to them. ",171.858,173.858,2,73
And my wake-up call came when I started ,173.858,175.858,2,73
"reading bedtime stories to my son, ",175.858,178.858,3,73
"and I found that at the end of day, ",178.858,180.858,2,73
"I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down -- you know, ",180.858,183.858,3,73
"I'd be speed reading ""The Cat In The Hat."" ",183.858,185.858,2,73

"paragraphs there, sometimes a whole page, ",187.858,189.858,2,73
"and of course, my little boy knew the book inside out, so we would quarrel. ",189.858,192.858,3,73
"And what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate, ",192.858,195.858,3,73
"the most tender moment of the day, ",195.858,197.858,2,73
"when a dad sits down to read to his son, ",197.858,200.858,3,73
"became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills, ",200.858,203.858,3,73
a clash between my speed ,203.858,205.858,2,73
and his slowness. ,205.858,208.858,3,73
"And this went on for some time, ",208.858,210.858,2,73
until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article ,210.858,212.858,2,73
with timesaving tips for fast people. ,212.858,214.858,2,73
And one of them made reference to a series of books called ,214.858,216.858,2,73
"""The One-Minute Bedtime Story."" ",216.858,218.858,2,73
"And I wince saying those words now, ",218.858,221.858,3,73
but my first reaction at the time was very different. ,221.858,223.858,2,73
"My first reflex was to say, ",223.858,225.858,2,73
"""Hallelujah -- what a great idea! ",225.858,227.858,2,73

"But thankfully, ",230.858,232.858,2,73
"a light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different, ",232.858,234.858,2,73
"and I took a step back, and I thought, ",235.858,237.858,2,73
"""Whoa -- you know, has it really come to this? ",237.858,239.858,2,73

"to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day?"" ",241.858,244.858,3,73
And I put away the newspaper -- ,245.858,247.858,2,73
"and I was getting on a plane -- and I sat there, ",247.858,249.858,2,73
and I did something I hadn't done for a long time -- which is I did nothing. ,249.858,251.858,2,73
"I just thought, and I thought long and hard. ",251.858,254.858,3,73
"And by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it. ",254.858,257.858,3,73
"I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture, ",257.858,260.858,3,73
and what it was doing to me and to everyone else. ,260.858,263.858,3,73
And I had two questions in my head. ,263.858,265.858,2,73
"The first was, how did we get so fast? ",265.858,268.858,3,73
"And the second is, is it possible, ",268.858,270.858,2,73
"or even desirable, to slow down? ",270.858,273.858,3,73
"Now, if you think about ",273.858,275.858,2,73
"how our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads. ",275.858,278.858,3,73
"You think of, you know, urbanization, ",278.858,280.858,2,73
"consumerism, the workplace, technology. ",280.858,283.858,3,73
But I think if you cut through ,283.858,285.858,2,73
"those forces, you get to what might be the deeper ",285.858,288.858,3,73
"driver, the nub of the question, ",288.858,291.858,3,73
which is how we think about time itself. ,291.858,293.858,2,73
"In other cultures, time is cyclical. ",293.858,296.858,3,73
"It's seen as moving in great, ",296.858,299.858,3,73
unhurried circles. ,299.858,301.858,2,73
It's always renewing and refreshing itself. ,301.858,303.858,2,73
"Whereas in the West, time is linear. ",303.858,305.858,2,73
It's a finite resource; ,305.858,307.858,2,73
it's always draining away. ,307.858,309.858,2,73
"You either use it, or lose it. ",309.858,311.858,2,73
"""Time is money,"" as Benjamin Franklin said. ",311.858,314.858,3,73
And I think what that does to us psychologically ,314.858,316.858,2,73
is it creates an equation. ,316.858,318.858,2,73
"Time is scarce, so what do we do? ",318.858,320.858,2,73
"Well -- well, we speed up, don't we? ",320.858,322.858,2,73
We try and do more and more with less and less time. ,322.858,324.858,2,73
We turn every moment of every day ,324.858,326.858,2,73
into a race to the finish line -- ,326.858,328.858,2,73
"a finish line, incidentally, that we never reach, ",328.858,331.858,3,73
but a finish line nonetheless. ,331.858,333.858,2,73
"And I guess that the question is, ",333.858,335.858,2,73
is it possible to break free from that mindset? ,335.858,337.858,2,73
"And thankfully, the answer is yes, because ",337.858,339.858,2,73
"what I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is ",339.858,341.858,2,73
a global backlash against this culture that ,341.858,344.858,3,73
"tells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best. ",344.858,347.858,3,73
"Right across the world, people are doing the unthinkable: ",347.858,350.858,3,73
"they're slowing down, and finding that, ",350.858,352.858,2,73
"although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down, you're road kill, ",352.858,355.858,3,73

"Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy, ",378.858,381.858,3,73
I'll just give you a very quick overview of ,383.858,386.858,3,73
"what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food, ",386.858,389.858,3,73
many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement. ,389.858,391.858,2,73
"Started in Italy, but has spread across the world, ",391.858,393.858,2,73
"and now has 100,000 members ",393.858,395.858,2,73
in 50 countries. ,395.858,397.858,2,73
"And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message, ",397.858,400.858,3,73
which is that we get more pleasure and more health ,400.858,403.858,3,73
from our food when we ,403.858,405.858,2,73
"cultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace. ",405.858,409.858,4,73
I think also the explosion of ,409.858,411.858,2,73
"the organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets, ",411.858,414.858,3,73
are other illustrations ,414.858,417.858,3,73
of the fact that people are desperate to get away from ,417.858,420.858,3,73
eating and cooking and cultivating their food ,420.858,422.858,2,73
on an industrial timetable. ,422.858,424.858,2,73
They want to get back to slower rhythms. ,424.858,427.858,3,73
And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something ,427.858,430.858,3,73
"called the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy, ",430.858,433.858,3,73
but has spread right across Europe and beyond. ,433.858,435.858,2,73
"And in this, towns ",435.858,437.858,2,73
"begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape, ",437.858,440.858,3,73
so that people are encouraged to slow down ,440.858,443.858,3,73
and smell the roses and connect with one another. ,443.858,445.858,2,73
"So they might curb traffic, ",445.858,447.858,2,73
"or put in a park bench, or some green space. ",447.858,450.858,3,73
"And in some ways, these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts, ",450.858,453.858,3,73
"because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City, ",453.858,456.858,3,73
it's kind of like a philosophical declaration. ,456.858,458.858,2,73
"It's saying to the rest of world, and to the people in that town, ",458.858,461.858,3,73
"that we believe that in the 21st century, ",461.858,463.858,2,73

"In medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned ",467.858,469.858,2,73
with the kind of quick-fix mentality ,469.858,471.858,2,73
you find in conventional medicine. ,471.858,473.858,2,73
And millions of them around the world are turning ,473.858,475.858,2,73
"to complementary and alternative forms of medicine, ",475.858,478.858,3,73
which tend to tap into sort of ,478.858,480.858,2,73
"slower, gentler, more holistic forms of healing. ",480.858,483.858,3,73
"Now, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies, ",483.858,486.858,3,73

But other treatments ,492.858,494.858,2,73
"such as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation, ",494.858,497.858,3,73
clearly have some kind of benefit. ,497.858,499.858,2,73

"I'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s, ",655.858,658.858,3,73
"and I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they ",658.858,660.858,2,73
"race around with more homework, ",660.858,662.858,2,73
"more tutoring, more extracurriculars ",662.858,664.858,2,73
than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago. ,664.858,667.858,3,73
And some of the most heartrending emails ,667.858,669.858,2,73
that I get on my website ,669.858,671.858,2,73
are actually from adolescents ,671.858,674.858,3,73
"hovering on the edge of burnout, pleading with me ",674.858,676.858,2,73
"to write to their parents, ",676.858,678.858,2,73
"to help them slow down, to help them get off this ",678.858,681.858,3,73
full-throttle treadmill. ,681.858,684.858,3,73
"But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well, ",684.858,686.858,2,73
"and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States ",686.858,688.858,2,73
are now banding together and banning extracurriculars ,688.858,691.858,3,73
"on a particular day of the month, so that people can, ",691.858,693.858,2,73
"you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down. ",693.858,696.858,3,73
Homework is another thing. There are homework bans ,697.858,700.858,3,73
springing up all over the developed world ,701.858,703.858,2,73
"in schools which had been piling on the homework for years, ",703.858,706.858,3,73
and now they're discovering that less can be more. ,706.858,708.858,2,73
So there was a case up in Scotland recently ,708.858,710.858,2,73
"where a fee-paying, high-achieving private school ",710.858,712.858,2,73
banned homework ,712.858,714.858,2,73
"for everyone under the age of 13, ",714.858,716.858,2,73
"and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said, ",716.858,718.858,2,73
"""What are you -- you know, our kids will fall"" -- the headmaster said, ",718.858,720.858,2,73
"""No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day."" ",720.858,723.858,3,73
"And just this last month, the exam results came in, ",723.858,726.858,3,73
"and in math, science, marks went up 20 percent ",726.858,729.858,3,73
on average last year. ,729.858,731.858,2,73
And I think what's very revealing is that ,731.858,733.858,2,73
"the elite universities, who are often cited as the reason ",733.858,736.858,3,73
"that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much, ",736.858,738.858,2,73
are starting to notice the caliber of students ,738.858,741.858,3,73
coming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks; ,741.858,744.858,3,73
"they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars, ",744.858,747.858,3,73
to the point that would make your eyes water. ,747.858,749.858,2,73
But they lack spark; they lack ,749.858,751.858,2,73
the ability to think creatively and think outside -- ,751.858,753.858,2,73
"they don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools, ",753.858,756.858,3,73
"and Oxford and Cambridge and so on, are starting to send a message ",756.858,758.858,2,73
to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit. ,758.858,761.858,3,73
"And in Harvard, for instance, they send out ",761.858,764.858,3,73
a letter to undergraduates -- freshmen -- ,764.858,767.858,3,73
"telling them that they'll get more out of life, and more out of Harvard, ",767.858,770.858,3,73
"if they put on the brakes, if they do less, ",770.858,772.858,2,73
"but give time to things, the time that things need, ",772.858,775.858,3,73
"to enjoy them, to savor them. ",775.858,777.858,2,73
And even if they sometimes do nothing at all. ,777.858,779.858,2,73
"And that letter is called -- very revealing, I think -- ",779.858,781.858,2,73
"""Slow Down!"" -- with an exclamation mark on the end. ",781.858,784.858,3,73
"So wherever you look, the message, it seems to me, is the same: ",784.858,787.858,3,73
"that less is very often more, ",787.858,789.858,2,73
that slower is very often ,789.858,792.858,3,73
"better. But that said, of course, ",792.858,794.858,2,73
"it's not that easy to slow down, is it? ",794.858,796.858,2,73
"I mean, you heard that I got a speeding ticket ",796.858,798.858,2,73
"while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness, ",798.858,800.858,2,73
"and that's true, but that's not all of it. ",800.858,802.858,2,73
I was actually en route to a dinner ,802.858,804.858,2,73
held by Slow Food at the time. ,804.858,806.858,2,73
"And if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy. ",806.858,809.858,3,73
"And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway, ",809.858,812.858,3,73
you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going. ,812.858,814.858,2,73
(Laughter) ,814.858,817.858,3,73
But why is it so hard to slow down? ,817.858,819.858,2,73
I think there are various reasons. ,819.858,821.858,2,73
"One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy. ",821.858,824.858,3,73
It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up. ,824.858,827.858,3,73
I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension -- ,827.858,829.858,2,73
that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off ,829.858,831.858,2,73
"from the bigger, deeper questions. ",831.858,833.858,2,73
"We fill our head with distraction, with busyness, ",833.858,835.858,2,73
"so that we don't have to ask, ",835.858,837.858,2,73
am I well? Am I happy? Are my children growing up right? ,837.858,840.858,3,73
Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf? ,840.858,843.858,3,73
"Another reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason -- ",844.858,846.858,2,73
why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo ,846.858,849.858,3,73
that we've erected against slowing down. ,849.858,852.858,3,73
"""Slow"" is a dirty word in our culture. ",852.858,854.858,2,73
"It's a byword for ""lazy,"" ""slacker,"" ",854.858,856.858,2,73
for being somebody who gives up. ,856.858,858.858,2,73
"You know, ""he's a bit slow."" It's actually synonymous ",858.858,860.858,2,73
with being stupid. ,860.858,863.858,3,73
"I guess what the Slow Movement -- the purpose of the Slow Movement, ",863.858,865.858,2,73
"or its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo, ",865.858,867.858,2,73
"and to say that yes, ",867.858,870.858,3,73
"sometimes slow is not the answer, ",870.858,872.858,2,73
"that there is such a thing as ""bad slow."" ",872.858,874.858,2,73
"You know, I got stuck on the M25, ",874.858,876.858,2,73
"which is a ring road around London, recently, ",876.858,878.858,2,73
"and spent three-and-a-half hours there. And I can tell you, ",878.858,880.858,2,73
that's really bad slow. ,880.858,882.858,2,73
"But the new idea, ",882.858,884.858,2,73
"the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement, ",884.858,886.858,2,73
"is that there is such a thing as ""good slow,"" too. ",886.858,888.858,2,73
"And good slow is, you know, taking the time ",888.858,890.858,2,73
"to eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off. ",890.858,893.858,3,73
Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles ,893.858,896.858,3,73
in the office to make the best decision ,896.858,898.858,2,73
at work. ,898.858,900.858,2,73
Or even simply just taking the time ,900.858,902.858,2,73
to slow down ,902.858,904.858,2,73
and savor your life. ,904.858,906.858,2,73
"Now, one of the things that I found most uplifting ",906.858,909.858,3,73
about all of this stuff that's happened around the book ,909.858,912.858,3,73
"since it came out, is the reaction to it. ",912.858,915.858,3,73
"And I knew that when my book on slowness came out, ",915.858,917.858,2,73
"it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade, ",917.858,919.858,2,73
"but it's also been taken up, with great gusto, ",919.858,922.858,3,73
"by the corporate world -- you know, ",922.858,924.858,2,73
"business press, but also ",924.858,926.858,2,73
big companies and leadership organizations. ,926.858,928.858,2,73
"Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think, ",928.858,931.858,3,73
are starting to realize that there's too much ,931.858,933.858,2,73
"speed in the system, ",933.858,935.858,2,73
"there's too much busyness, and it's time to find, ",935.858,938.858,3,73
or get back to that lost art of shifting gears. ,938.858,942.858,4,73
"Another encouraging sign, I think, ",942.858,944.858,2,73
is that it's not just in the developed world ,944.858,946.858,2,73
"that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world, ",946.858,949.858,3,73
in countries that are on the verge of making that leap ,949.858,951.858,2,73
"into first world status -- China, Brazil, ",951.858,953.858,2,73
"Thailand, Poland, and so on -- ",953.858,955.858,2,73
"these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement, ",955.858,958.858,3,73
"many people in them, and there's a debate going on ",958.858,961.858,3,73
"in their media, on the streets. ",961.858,963.858,2,73
"Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying, ",963.858,965.858,2,73
"""Well, we like that aspect of what you've got, ",965.858,968.858,3,73
"but we're not so sure about that."" ",968.858,970.858,2,73
"So all of that said, is it, ",970.858,972.858,2,73
"I guess, is it possible? ",972.858,975.858,3,73
That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible ,975.858,978.858,3,73
to slow down? And ,978.858,980.858,2,73
I'm happy to be able to say to you ,980.858,982.858,2,73
that the answer is a resounding yes. ,982.858,984.858,2,73
"And I present myself as Exhibit A, ",984.858,987.858,3,73
a kind of reformed and rehabilitated ,987.858,990.858,3,73
speed-aholic. ,990.858,992.858,2,73
"I still love speed. You know, I live in London, ",992.858,994.858,2,73
"and I work as a journalist, ",994.858,996.858,2,73
"and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness, ",996.858,998.858,2,73
and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things. ,998.858,1000.858,2,73
"I play squash and ice hockey, ",1000.858,1002.858,2,73
"two very fast sports, and I wouldn't give them up for the world. ",1002.858,1005.858,3,73
"But I've also, over the last year or so, ",1006.858,1009.858,3,73
got in touch with my inner tortoise. ,1009.858,1011.858,2,73
(Laughter) ,1011.858,1012.858,1,73
And what that means is that ,1012.858,1014.858,2,73
I no longer ,1014.858,1017.858,3,73
overload myself gratuitously. ,1017.858,1020.858,3,73
My default mode is no longer ,1020.858,1023.858,3,73
to be a rush-aholic. ,1023.858,1025.858,2,73
I no longer hear ,1026.858,1028.858,2,73
"time's winged chariot drawing near, ",1028.858,1030.858,2,73
or at least not as much as I did before. ,1030.858,1032.858,2,73
"I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off. ",1032.858,1035.858,3,73
And the upshot of all of that is that ,1036.858,1038.858,2,73
"I actually feel a lot happier, healthier, ",1038.858,1041.858,3,73
more productive than I ever have. ,1041.858,1044.858,3,73
I feel like I'm living ,1044.858,1046.858,2,73
my life rather than actually just racing through it. ,1046.858,1049.858,3,73
"And perhaps, the most important ",1050.858,1052.858,2,73
measure of the success of this ,1052.858,1054.858,2,73
"is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper, ",1054.858,1057.858,3,73
"richer, stronger. ",1057.858,1059.858,2,73
"And for me, I guess, the litmus test ",1059.858,1062.858,3,73
"for whether this would work, and what it would mean, ",1062.858,1064.858,2,73
"was always going to be bedtime stories, because that's sort of where ",1064.858,1067.858,3,73
the journey began. And there too the news is ,1067.858,1070.858,3,73
"rosy. You know, ",1070.858,1072.858,2,73
"at the end of the day, I go into my son's room. ",1072.858,1074.858,2,73
"I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer, ",1074.858,1076.858,2,73
"so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket, ",1076.858,1078.858,2,73
and I just slow down to his pace and we read. ,1078.858,1081.858,3,73
"And because children have their own tempo and internal clock, ",1082.858,1085.858,3,73
"they don't do quality time, ",1085.858,1087.858,2,73
where you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you. ,1087.858,1089.858,2,73
They need you to move at their rhythm. ,1089.858,1092.858,3,73
"I find that 10 minutes into a story, you know, ",1092.858,1094.858,2,73
"my son will suddenly say, ""You know, ",1094.858,1096.858,2,73
"something happened in the playground today that really bothered me."" ",1096.858,1098.858,2,73
And we'll go off and have a conversation on that. ,1098.858,1101.858,3,73
And I now find that bedtime stories ,1101.858,1104.858,3,73
used to be ,1104.858,1106.858,2,73
"a box on my to-do list, something that I dreaded, ",1106.858,1109.858,3,73
because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly. ,1109.858,1111.858,2,73
"It's become my reward at the end of the day, ",1111.858,1113.858,2,73
something I really cherish. ,1113.858,1115.858,2,73
And I have a kind of Hollywood ending ,1115.858,1117.858,2,73
"to my talk this afternoon, ",1117.858,1119.858,2,73
which goes a little bit like this: ,1119.858,1121.858,2,73
"a few months ago, I was getting ready to go on ",1121.858,1124.858,3,73
"another book tour, and I had my bags packed. ",1124.858,1127.858,3,73
"I was downstairs by the front door, and I was waiting for a taxi, ",1127.858,1130.858,3,73
and my son came down the stairs and ,1130.858,1132.858,2,73
he'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it. ,1132.858,1134.858,2,73
"He'd gone and stapled two cards, very like these, together, ",1134.858,1136.858,2,73
and put a sticker of his favorite ,1136.858,1139.858,3,73
"character, Tintin, on the front. ",1139.858,1141.858,2,73
"And he said to me, ",1141.858,1143.858,2,73
"or he handed this to me, and I read it, ",1143.858,1145.858,2,73
"and it said, ""To Daddy, love Benjamin."" ",1145.858,1147.858,2,73

"Is that a good luck on the book tour card?"" ",1150.858,1153.858,3,73
"And he said, ""No, no, no, Daddy -- this is a card ",1153.858,1155.858,2,73
"for being the best story reader in the world."" ",1155.858,1157.858,2,73
"And I thought, ""Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work."" ",1157.858,1160.858,3,73
"When I'm starting talks like this, ",24.858,26.858,2,74
I usually do a whole spiel about sustainability ,26.858,29.858,3,74
because a lot of people out there don't know what that is. ,29.858,31.858,2,74
"This is a crowd that does know what it is, ",31.858,33.858,2,74
so I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right? ,33.858,37.858,4,74
"So just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know? ",37.858,39.858,2,74
Fill in the blanks. ,39.858,40.858,1,74
"So, you know, sustainability, small planet. ",40.858,43.858,3,74

"You know, about a million years ago, ",45.858,46.858,1,74
"a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees, ",46.858,48.858,2,74
"got a little clever, harnessed fire, ",48.858,50.858,2,74
"invented the printing press, ",50.858,51.858,1,74
"made, you know, luggage with wheels on it. ",51.858,53.858,2,74
"And, you know, built the society that we now live in. ",53.858,57.858,4,74
"Unfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt, ",57.858,60.858,3,74
"the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created, ",60.858,64.858,4,74
"it's got some major, major flaws. ",64.858,67.858,3,74
One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint. ,67.858,71.858,4,74
It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable. ,71.858,75.858,4,74
"How much stuff goes through your life, ",75.858,78.858,3,74
how much waste is left behind you. ,78.858,81.858,3,74
"And we, at the moment, in our society, ",81.858,84.858,3,74
have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this. ,84.858,88.858,4,74

"If everybody on the planet lived the way we did, ",90.858,93.858,3,74
"we'd need between five, six, seven, ",93.858,95.858,2,74
some people even say 10 planets to make it. ,95.858,98.858,3,74
Clearly we don't have 10 planets. ,98.858,100.858,2,74
"Again, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet, ",100.858,102.858,2,74
"10 planets, one planet. Right? ",102.858,104.858,2,74
We don't have that. So that's one problem. ,104.858,107.858,3,74
The second problem is that the planet that we have ,107.858,109.858,2,74
is being used in wildly unfair ways. Right? ,109.858,113.858,4,74
"North Americans, such as myself, you know, ",113.858,116.858,3,74
"we're basically sort of wallowing, gluttonous hogs, ",116.858,118.858,2,74
and we're eating all sorts of stuff. ,118.858,120.858,2,74
"And, you know, then you get all the way down ",120.858,122.858,2,74
"to people who live in the Asia-Pacific region, or even more, Africa. ",122.858,126.858,4,74
And people simply do not have enough to survive. ,126.858,128.858,2,74
"This is producing all sorts of tensions, ",128.858,130.858,2,74
all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing. ,130.858,133.858,3,74
And there's more and more people on the way. Right? ,133.858,137.858,4,74
"So, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years. ",137.858,141.858,4,74
"It's going to be a pretty crowded place, at least eight billion people. ",141.858,144.858,3,74
"So to make matters even more difficult, it's a very young planet. ",144.858,148.858,4,74
A third of the people on this planet are kids. ,148.858,151.858,3,74
And those kids are growing up in a completely different way ,151.858,154.858,3,74
"than their parents did, no matter where they live. ",154.858,156.858,2,74
"They've been exposed to this idea of our society, of our prosperity. ",156.858,161.858,5,74
And they may not want to live exactly like us. ,161.858,164.858,3,74
"They may not want to be Americans, or Brits, ",164.858,166.858,2,74
"or Germans, or South Africans, ",166.858,168.858,2,74
but they want their own version ,168.858,170.858,2,74
"of a life which is more prosperous, and more dynamic, ",170.858,172.858,2,74
"and more, you know, enjoyable. ",172.858,174.858,2,74
And all of these things combine to create ,174.858,177.858,3,74
an enormous amount of torque on the planet. ,177.858,180.858,3,74
"And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque, ",180.858,183.858,3,74
we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly ,183.858,187.858,4,74
facing situations which are simply unthinkable. ,187.858,191.858,4,74
Everybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios. ,191.858,193.858,2,74
I don't need to go into that. ,193.858,195.858,2,74
"But I will ask the question, what's the alternative? ",195.858,197.858,2,74
"And I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable. ",197.858,202.858,5,74
"You know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable; ",202.858,205.858,3,74
on the other hand we have the unimaginable. ,205.858,207.858,2,74
We don't know yet how to build a society ,207.858,210.858,3,74
"which is environmentally sustainable, ",210.858,212.858,2,74
"which is shareable with everybody on the planet, ",212.858,215.858,3,74
"which promotes stability and democracy and human rights, ",215.858,219.858,4,74
and which is achievable in the time-frame necessary ,219.858,222.858,3,74
to make it through the challenges we face. ,222.858,225.858,3,74
We don't know how to do this yet. ,225.858,227.858,2,74
So what's Worldchanging? ,227.858,229.858,2,74
"Well, Worldchanging you might think of ",229.858,231.858,2,74
as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future. ,231.858,236.858,5,74
"You know, what we're out there doing is looking ",236.858,238.858,2,74
"for examples of tools, models and ideas, ",238.858,241.858,3,74
"which, if widely adopted, would change the game. ",241.858,245.858,4,74
"A lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things ",245.858,248.858,3,74
"that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of, ",248.858,251.858,3,74
but most people haven't. ,251.858,253.858,2,74
"So I thought today I'd do something a little different, ",253.858,255.858,2,74
"and talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know, ",255.858,258.858,3,74
rather than giving you tried-and-true examples. ,258.858,261.858,3,74
Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out. ,261.858,263.858,2,74
Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook. ,263.858,265.858,2,74
"And given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick. ",265.858,268.858,3,74
"So, I don't know, just stick with me. Right? ",268.858,270.858,2,74
"So, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city. ",270.858,273.858,3,74
One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world ,273.858,276.858,3,74
for changing the impact that we have on the planet ,276.858,278.858,2,74
is changing the way that we live in cities. ,278.858,280.858,2,74
We're already an urban planet; ,280.858,281.858,1,74
that's especially true in the developed world. ,281.858,284.858,3,74
And people who live in cities in the developed world ,284.858,286.858,2,74
"tend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff. ",286.858,288.858,2,74
"If we can change the dynamic, ",288.858,290.858,2,74
by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ... ,290.858,293.858,3,74
"Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there, ",293.858,295.858,2,74
you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city. ,295.858,297.858,2,74
"And they are doing density, new density, ",297.858,299.858,2,74
better than probably anybody else on the planet right now. ,299.858,301.858,2,74
"They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars, ",301.858,304.858,3,74
which is a pretty great thing. ,304.858,306.858,2,74
So you have density. You also have growth management. ,306.858,308.858,2,74
You leave aside what is natural to be natural. ,308.858,311.858,3,74
This is in Portland. That is an actual development. ,311.858,314.858,3,74
That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity. ,314.858,316.858,2,74
They've bounded the city with a line. ,316.858,318.858,2,74
"Nature, city. Nothing changes. ",318.858,320.858,2,74
"Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments. ",321.858,324.858,3,74
"You can start doing things like, you know, ",324.858,326.858,2,74
"transit systems that actually work to transport people, ",326.858,329.858,3,74
in effective and reasonably comfortable manners. ,329.858,332.858,3,74
You can also start to change what you build. ,332.858,334.858,2,74
"This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London, ",334.858,337.858,3,74
which is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place. ,337.858,340.858,3,74
"We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity, ",340.858,343.858,3,74
"that recycle much of their water, ",343.858,345.858,2,74
"that are much more comfortable than standard buildings, ",345.858,348.858,3,74
"use all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less. ",348.858,352.858,4,74
"Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much. ",352.858,356.858,4,74
But once you also have people living ,356.858,358.858,2,74
"in close proximity to each other, ",358.858,360.858,2,74
one of the things you can do is -- ,360.858,362.858,2,74
as information technologies develop -- ,362.858,364.858,2,74
you can start to have smart places. ,364.858,366.858,2,74
You can start to know where things are. ,366.858,368.858,2,74
"When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them. ",368.858,370.858,2,74
"When you share them, you end up using less. ",370.858,373.858,3,74
"So one great example is car-share clubs, ",373.858,375.858,2,74
"which are really starting to take off in the U.S., ",375.858,377.858,2,74
"have already taken off in many places in Europe, and are a great example. ",377.858,380.858,3,74
"If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week, ",380.858,382.858,2,74
do you really need your own car? ,382.858,384.858,2,74
Another thing that information technology lets us do ,385.858,387.858,2,74
is start figuring out how to use less stuff ,387.858,389.858,2,74
"by knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using. ",389.858,394.858,5,74
"So, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use, ",394.858,397.858,3,74
"which I think is a pretty cool concept, ",397.858,399.858,2,74
"although I think it ought to work the other way around, ",399.858,401.858,2,74
that it gets brighter the more you don't use. ,401.858,404.858,3,74
"But, you know, there may even be a simpler approach. ",404.858,406.858,2,74
We could just re-label things. ,406.858,408.858,2,74
"This light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods, ",408.858,410.858,2,74
"and on the other hand, off. ",410.858,412.858,2,74
How we build things can change as well. ,412.858,414.858,2,74
This is a bio-morphic building. ,414.858,416.858,2,74
It takes its inspiration in form from life. ,416.858,420.858,4,74
"Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful, ",420.858,422.858,2,74
and also much more effective. ,422.858,424.858,2,74
"This is an example of bio-mimicry, ",425.858,427.858,2,74
which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for. ,427.858,429.858,2,74
"In this case, you have a shell design ",429.858,431.858,2,74
"which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan, which is greatly more effective. ",431.858,435.858,4,74
There's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable. ,435.858,438.858,3,74
I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it. ,439.858,441.858,2,74
We're starting to cover this more and more. ,441.858,443.858,2,74
"There's also neo-biological design, ",443.858,445.858,2,74
where more and more we're actually using life itself ,445.858,447.858,2,74
and the processes of life to become part of our industry. ,447.858,450.858,3,74
"So this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae. ",450.858,453.858,3,74
"So we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking for ",453.858,457.858,4,74
"of how to take the cities most of us live in, ",457.858,460.858,3,74
and turn them into Bright Green cities. ,460.858,462.858,2,74
"But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. ",462.858,467.858,5,74
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world. ,467.858,470.858,3,74
"And there's a statistic I often like to use, ",470.858,472.858,2,74
"which is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days, ",472.858,475.858,3,74
a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days. ,475.858,478.858,3,74
"I was giving a talk about two months ago, ",478.858,480.858,2,74
"and this guy, who'd done some work with the U.N., came up to me ",480.858,482.858,2,74
"and was really flustered, and he said, look, ",482.858,484.858,2,74
you've got that totally wrong; it's totally wrong. ,484.858,486.858,2,74
It's every seven days. ,486.858,488.858,2,74
"So, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days, ",489.858,492.858,3,74
and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in. ,492.858,496.858,4,74
Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly. ,496.858,499.858,3,74
They don't have existing infrastructure; ,499.858,501.858,2,74
"they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty, ",501.858,504.858,3,74
and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out ,504.858,506.858,2,74
how to do things in new ways. ,506.858,508.858,2,74
So what do we need in order to make developing nation ,508.858,512.858,4,74
megacities into Bright Green megacities? ,512.858,515.858,3,74
"Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging. ",515.858,518.858,3,74
And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere. ,518.858,521.858,3,74
The idea behind leapfrogging is that ,521.858,523.858,2,74
"if you are a person, or a country, who is stuck in a situation ",523.858,526.858,3,74
"where you don't have the tools and technologies that you need, ",526.858,529.858,3,74
there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right? ,529.858,535.858,6,74
"That you're much better off, almost universally, ",535.858,537.858,2,74
looking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology. ,537.858,542.858,5,74
One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right? ,542.858,546.858,4,74
"All throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones, ",546.858,550.858,4,74
skipping the whole landline stage. ,550.858,552.858,2,74
"If there are landlines in many developing world cities, ",552.858,554.858,2,74
they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot ,554.858,557.858,3,74
and cost enormous amounts of money. ,557.858,559.858,2,74
So I rather like this picture here. ,559.858,561.858,2,74
"I particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone. ",561.858,565.858,4,74
"So what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society. ",565.858,569.858,4,74
"We've heard all about this here this week, ",569.858,571.858,2,74
"so I won't say too much more than that, other than to say ",571.858,573.858,2,74
what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies. ,573.858,578.858,5,74
"The second thing is tools for collaboration, ",578.858,581.858,3,74
"be they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems ",581.858,584.858,3,74
which encourage collaboration. Right? ,584.858,586.858,2,74
"When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate, ",586.858,590.858,4,74
you get different kinds of solutions. ,590.858,592.858,2,74
And those solutions are accessible in a different way ,592.858,595.858,3,74
to people who don't have capital. Right? ,595.858,597.858,2,74
"So, you know, we have open source software, ",597.858,600.858,3,74
we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions. ,600.858,605.858,5,74
And those things lead to things like this. ,605.858,607.858,2,74
This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo. ,607.858,610.858,3,74
This is a pretty remarkable program ,610.858,612.858,2,74
"using free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines, ",612.858,616.858,4,74
and basically sort of abandoned buildings -- ,616.858,619.858,3,74
has put together a bunch of community centers ,619.858,621.858,2,74
"where people can come in, get high-speed internet access, ",621.858,624.858,3,74
learn computer programming skills for free. ,624.858,627.858,3,74
And a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo. ,628.858,631.858,3,74
And those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo. ,632.858,635.858,3,74
I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back. (Laughter) ,635.858,638.858,3,74
So one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion. ,639.858,644.858,5,74
"And one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchanging ",644.858,647.858,3,74
"is the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself, ",647.858,651.858,4,74
and re-categorizing itself in ways ,651.858,654.858,3,74
that have less and less to do with most of us in this room. ,654.858,657.858,3,74
"So it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right? ",657.858,662.858,5,74
"You know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels. ",662.858,665.858,3,74
It's doing something new. There's new things happening. ,665.858,668.858,3,74
"There's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things. ",668.858,671.858,3,74
"Like, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie ""City of God?"" ",671.858,674.858,3,74
"Yeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it. ",674.858,677.858,3,74
"And it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way. ",677.858,680.858,3,74
You have other radical examples ,680.858,682.858,2,74
where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out. ,682.858,685.858,3,74
These are people who have just been visited by ,685.858,687.858,2,74
the Internet bookmobile in Uganda. ,687.858,689.858,2,74
"And who are waving their first books in the air, ",689.858,691.858,2,74
"which, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know? ",691.858,694.858,3,74
So you also have the ability for people to start coming together ,694.858,698.858,4,74
"and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways, ",698.858,703.858,5,74
in ways that haven't happened before. ,704.858,707.858,3,74
"And as we heard last night, as we've heard earlier this week, ",707.858,709.858,2,74
"are absolutely, fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions, ",709.858,715.858,6,74
is we've got to craft new political realities. ,715.858,718.858,3,74
"And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities, ",718.858,722.858,4,74
"not only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan, ",722.858,727.858,5,74
"what have you, but here at home as well. ",727.858,729.858,2,74
Another world is possible. ,729.858,731.858,2,74
And sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement. Right? ,731.858,735.858,4,74
We tweak that a lot. ,735.858,737.858,2,74
We talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here. ,737.858,740.858,3,74
That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine ,740.858,742.858,2,74
"there being a different, vague possibility out there, ",742.858,746.858,4,74
but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility. ,746.858,750.858,4,74
"We need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil. ",750.858,753.858,3,74
How many people knew of Lula before today? ,753.858,756.858,3,74
"OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that. ",756.858,760.858,4,74
"So Lula, he's full of problems, full of contradictions, ",760.858,762.858,2,74
"but one of the things that he's doing is, ",762.858,764.858,2,74
he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that ,764.858,770.858,6,74
completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue ,770.858,776.858,6,74
into a whole new way of global collaboration. ,776.858,780.858,4,74
I would keep your eye on this fellow. ,780.858,782.858,2,74
Another example of this sort of second superpower thing ,783.858,786.858,3,74
"is the rise of these games that are what we call ""serious play."" ",786.858,790.858,4,74
We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere. ,790.858,792.858,2,74
"This is from ""A Force More Powerful."" It's a little screenshot. ",792.858,795.858,3,74
"""A Force More Powerful"" is a video game that, ",795.858,797.858,2,74
"while you're playing it, it teaches you how to engage ",797.858,800.858,3,74
in non-violent insurrection and regime change. (Laughter) ,800.858,802.858,2,74
"Here's another one. This is from a game called ""Food Force,"" ",802.858,805.858,3,74
which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp. ,805.858,808.858,3,74
These things are all contributing in a very dynamic way ,809.858,813.858,4,74
"to a huge rise in, especially in the developing world, ",813.858,818.858,5,74
in people's interest in and passion for democracy. ,818.858,821.858,3,74
We get so little news about the developing world ,821.858,824.858,3,74
that we often forget that there are literally ,824.858,828.858,4,74
millions of people out there struggling to change things ,828.858,830.858,2,74
"to be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt. ",830.858,834.858,4,74
"And, you know, we don't hear those stories enough. ",834.858,836.858,2,74
"But it's happening all over the place, ",836.858,838.858,2,74
and these tools are part of what's making it possible. ,838.858,840.858,2,74
"Now when you add all those things together, ",840.858,842.858,2,74
"when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools, ",842.858,844.858,2,74
"you know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get? ",844.858,848.858,4,74
"Well, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world. ",848.858,852.858,4,74
"You get, for example, green power spread throughout the world. ",852.858,856.858,4,74
"You get -- this is a building in Hyderabad, India. ",856.858,858.858,2,74
It's the greenest building in the world. ,858.858,860.858,2,74
"You get grassroots solutions, things that work ",860.858,862.858,2,74
for people who have no capital or limited access. ,862.858,864.858,2,74
You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains. ,864.858,868.858,4,74
You get access to distance medicine. ,868.858,870.858,2,74
These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs ,870.858,873.858,3,74
to access databases that have information ,873.858,875.858,2,74
that they don't have access to at home in a distant manner. ,875.858,878.858,3,74
You get new tools for people in the developing world. ,878.858,881.858,3,74
"These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there, ",881.858,885.858,4,74
"for whom nightfall means darkness, ",885.858,887.858,2,74
to have a new means of operating. ,887.858,889.858,2,74
These are refrigerators that require no electricity; ,889.858,892.858,3,74
they're pot within a pot design. ,892.858,894.858,2,74
And you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems. ,894.858,897.858,3,74
Here's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap ,897.858,899.858,2,74
and available to people in the developing world. ,899.858,901.858,2,74
Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight. ,901.858,905.858,4,74
"Here's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area, ",906.858,911.858,5,74
will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable. ,911.858,914.858,3,74
Here's a way of transporting water. ,914.858,916.858,2,74
"I just love this, you know -- I mean carrying water is such a drag, ",916.858,919.858,3,74
"and somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right? ",919.858,922.858,3,74
"I mean, that's a great design. ",922.858,924.858,2,74
"This is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw. ",924.858,927.858,3,74
Basically you can suck any water through this ,927.858,930.858,3,74
and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips. ,930.858,933.858,3,74
"So, you know, people who are in desperate straits can get this. ",933.858,936.858,3,74
This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever. ,936.858,939.858,3,74
"This is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout, ",939.858,942.858,3,74
which pumps water as kids play. You know? ,942.858,946.858,4,74
"Seriously -- give that one a hand, it's pretty great. ",947.858,950.858,3,74
And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right? ,950.858,954.858,4,74
We're expecting to have upwards of 200 million refugees by the year 2020 ,954.858,958.858,4,74
because of climate change and political instability. ,958.858,960.858,2,74
How do we help people like that? ,960.858,962.858,2,74
"Well, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs ",962.858,964.858,2,74
that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet. ,964.858,967.858,3,74
"Some of those designs include models for acting, ",967.858,970.858,3,74
such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps. ,970.858,973.858,3,74
New models for pedagogy for the displaced. ,973.858,976.858,3,74
And we have new tools. ,976.858,978.858,2,74
This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere. ,978.858,980.858,2,74
Does anyone know what this is? ,980.858,982.858,2,74
Audience: It detects landmines. ,982.858,983.858,1,74
"Alex Steffen: Exactly, this is a landmine-detecting flower. ",983.858,986.858,3,74
If you are living in one of the places ,987.858,989.858,2,74
"where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered, ",989.858,992.858,3,74
you can fling these seeds out into the field. ,992.858,995.858,3,74
"And as they grow up, they will grow up around the mines, ",995.858,999.858,4,74
"their roots will detect the chemicals in them, ",999.858,1002.858,3,74
and where the flowers turn red you don't step. ,1002.858,1005.858,3,74
"Yeah, so seeds that could save your life. You know? ",1007.858,1011.858,4,74
(Applause) ,1011.858,1012.858,1,74
I also love it because it seems to me ,1012.858,1014.858,2,74
"that the example, the tools we use to change the world, ",1014.858,1020.858,6,74
ought to be beautiful in themselves. ,1020.858,1023.858,3,74
"You know, that it's not just enough to survive. ",1023.858,1025.858,2,74
We've got to make something better than what we've got. ,1025.858,1028.858,3,74
And I think that we will. ,1029.858,1031.858,2,74
"Just to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G. Wells, ",1032.858,1035.858,3,74
I think that better things are on the way. ,1035.858,1037.858,2,74
"I think that, in fact, that ""all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning. ",1037.858,1041.858,4,74
All that the human mind has accomplished ,1041.858,1043.858,2,74
"is but the dream before the awakening."" ",1043.858,1045.858,2,74
I hope that that turns out to be true. ,1045.858,1048.858,3,74
The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will. ,1048.858,1051.858,3,74
Thank you very much. ,1051.858,1052.858,1,74
"If you'd like to learn how to play the lobster, we have some here. ",24.858,27.858,3,77
"And that's not a joke, we really do. ",27.858,29.858,2,77
So come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster. ,29.858,32.858,3,77
"So, actually, I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp ",32.858,36.858,4,77
a few years ago because they make sound. ,36.858,39.858,3,77
This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp ,39.858,41.858,2,77
that's found off the coast of California. ,41.858,43.858,2,77
"And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound, ",54.858,57.858,3,77
it actually turns out to be a very difficult project. ,57.858,60.858,3,77
"And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp, ",60.858,65.858,5,77
"or stomatopods, make sound, I started to think about their appendages. ",65.858,69.858,4,77
"And mantis shrimp are called ""mantis shrimp"" after the praying mantises, ",69.858,72.858,3,77
"which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think, ",72.858,76.858,4,77
"well, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds, ",76.858,79.858,3,77
to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes. ,79.858,82.858,3,77
"And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike, ",82.858,86.858,4,77
work that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell. ,86.858,89.858,3,77
"So, mantis shrimp come in two varieties: ",89.858,92.858,3,77
there are spearers and smashers. ,92.858,94.858,2,77
"And this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod. ",94.858,97.858,3,77
"And he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead. ",97.858,102.858,5,77
"So, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit, ",102.858,107.858,5,77
this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species -- ,107.858,109.858,2,77
"recorded at 1,000 frames a second, ",109.858,111.858,2,77
played back at 15 frames per second. ,111.858,113.858,2,77
"And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs, ",113.858,119.858,6,77
exploding upward to actually just catch ,119.858,122.858,3,77
a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it. ,122.858,124.858,2,77
"Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod, ",124.858,129.858,5,77
and these guys open up snails for a living. ,129.858,132.858,3,77
And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack. ,132.858,137.858,5,77
(Laughter) ,137.858,138.858,1,77
"So, I'll play it one more time. ",138.858,140.858,2,77
"He wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash. ",140.858,144.858,4,77
"And a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner. ",144.858,151.858,7,77
"So, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end, ",151.858,155.858,4,77
or it can smash with the heel. ,155.858,157.858,2,77
And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike. ,157.858,160.858,3,77
"And so the first question that came to mind was, ",160.858,162.858,2,77
"well, how fast does this limb move? ",162.858,165.858,3,77
Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video. ,165.858,168.858,3,77
And I immediately came upon a problem. ,168.858,171.858,3,77
Every single high-speed video system in the biology department ,171.858,174.858,3,77
at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement. ,174.858,178.858,4,77
We simply couldn't capture it on video. ,178.858,180.858,2,77
And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time. ,180.858,183.858,3,77
"And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department, ",183.858,186.858,3,77
looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology. ,186.858,191.858,5,77
And so we struck up a deal. ,191.858,193.858,2,77
"I said, ""Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system ",193.858,195.858,2,77
"that could capture these movements, ",195.858,197.858,2,77
"you guys can film us collecting the data."" ",197.858,200.858,3,77
"And believe it or not, they went for it. (Laughter) ",200.858,202.858,2,77
So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology -- ,202.858,206.858,4,77
it just came out about a year ago -- ,206.858,208.858,2,77
that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light. ,208.858,213.858,5,77
"And low light is a critical issue with filming animals, ",213.858,215.858,2,77
"because if it's too high, you fry them. (Laughter) ",215.858,218.858,3,77
"So this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here, ",218.858,223.858,5,77
"and there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel. ",223.858,226.858,3,77
And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail. ,226.858,229.858,3,77
"And the snail's wired to a stick, ",229.858,230.858,1,77
so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And -- yeah. ,230.858,234.858,4,77
(Laughter) ,234.858,236.858,2,77
I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here. ,236.858,239.858,3,77
(Laughter) ,239.858,241.858,2,77
"So this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second, ",241.858,246.858,5,77
and I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times. ,246.858,251.858,5,77
"And as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast ",251.858,254.858,3,77
slowed down 333 times. It's an incredibly powerful movement. ,254.858,258.858,4,77
The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards -- ,258.858,261.858,3,77
just a spectacular movement. ,261.858,264.858,3,77
"And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos, ",264.858,266.858,2,77
and we measured how fast the limb was moving ,266.858,268.858,2,77
to get back to that original question. ,268.858,270.858,2,77
And we were in for our first surprise. ,270.858,273.858,3,77
So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving ,273.858,276.858,3,77
at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second ,276.858,278.858,2,77
all the way up to 23 meters per second. ,278.858,280.858,2,77
"And for those of you who prefer miles per hour, ",280.858,282.858,2,77
that's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast. ,282.858,287.858,5,77
"In fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point ",287.858,291.858,4,77
on the extreme animal movement spectrum. ,291.858,294.858,3,77
And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike ,294.858,297.858,3,77
of any animal system. So our first surprise. ,297.858,301.858,4,77
(Applause) ,301.858,302.858,1,77
So that was really cool and very unexpected. ,302.858,305.858,3,77
"So, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it? ",305.858,308.858,3,77
"And actually, this work was done in the 1960s ",308.858,311.858,3,77
by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows. ,311.858,313.858,2,77
And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use ,313.858,316.858,3,77
"what's called a ""catch mechanism,"" or ""click mechanism."" ",316.858,319.858,3,77
And what this basically consists of is a large muscle ,319.858,323.858,4,77
"that takes a good long time to contract, ",323.858,325.858,2,77
and a latch that prevents anything from moving. ,325.858,328.858,3,77
"So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens. ",328.858,330.858,2,77
"And once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up -- ",330.858,333.858,3,77
"the latch flies upward, and you've got the movement. ",333.858,337.858,4,77
"And that's basically what's called a ""power amplification system."" ",337.858,340.858,3,77
"It takes a long time for the muscle to contract, ",340.858,342.858,2,77
and a very short time for the limb to fly out. ,342.858,344.858,2,77
And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story. ,344.858,347.858,3,77
This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes. ,347.858,351.858,4,77
But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History. ,351.858,355.858,4,77
"And if any of you ever have a chance, ",355.858,357.858,2,77
backstage of the National Museum of Natural History ,357.858,359.858,2,77
is one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what -- ,359.858,363.858,4,77
(Laughter) ,363.858,364.858,1,77
this is serious business for me. ,364.858,366.858,2,77
(Laughter) ,366.858,367.858,1,77
"So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb, ",367.858,372.858,5,77
"whether it's a spearer or a smasher, ",372.858,374.858,2,77
is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure ,374.858,376.858,2,77
right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here. ,376.858,380.858,4,77
It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse. ,380.858,382.858,2,77
It's a very beautiful structure. ,382.858,384.858,2,77
And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas ,384.858,389.858,5,77
suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure. ,389.858,393.858,4,77
And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while. ,393.858,396.858,3,77
"And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show ",396.858,400.858,4,77
is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring. ,400.858,404.858,4,77
There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism ,404.858,407.858,3,77
"in order to generate the amount of force that we observe, ",407.858,409.858,2,77
"and the speed that we observe, and the output of the system. ",409.858,412.858,3,77
"So we thought, OK, this must be a spring -- ",412.858,415.858,3,77
the saddle could very well be a spring. ,415.858,417.858,2,77
"And we went back to those high-speed videos again, ",417.858,419.858,2,77
and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending. ,419.858,425.858,6,77
And I'll just do that one more time. ,425.858,428.858,3,77
And then if you take a look at the video -- ,428.858,430.858,2,77
it's a little bit hard to see -- it's outlined in yellow. ,430.858,432.858,2,77
The saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it ,432.858,434.858,2,77
"extending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending. ",434.858,438.858,4,77
"So, we've had very solid evidence showing ",438.858,440.858,2,77
"that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends, ",440.858,444.858,4,77
"and does, in fact, function as a spring. ",444.858,446.858,2,77
"The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a ""hyperbolic paraboloid surface,"" ",446.858,451.858,5,77
"or an ""anticlastic surface."" ",451.858,453.858,2,77
"And this is very well known to engineers and architects, ",453.858,455.858,2,77
because it's a very strong surface in compression. ,455.858,458.858,3,77
"It has curves in two directions, ",458.858,460.858,2,77
"one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other, ",460.858,463.858,3,77
so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces ,463.858,466.858,3,77
over the surface of this type of shape. ,466.858,469.858,3,77
"So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists. ",469.858,473.858,4,77
"It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry, ",473.858,477.858,4,77
because it requires very little material ,477.858,480.858,3,77
"to build this type of surface, and it's very strong. ",480.858,483.858,3,77
"So if you're going to build a thin gold structure, ",483.858,485.858,2,77
it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong. ,485.858,487.858,2,77
"Now, it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects ",487.858,492.858,5,77
"is Eduardo Catalano, who popularized this structure. ",492.858,495.858,3,77
And what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built ,495.858,498.858,3,77
that's 87 and a half feet spanwise. ,498.858,502.858,4,77
"It's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points. ",502.858,505.858,3,77
And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's -- ,505.858,510.858,5,77
he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure ,510.858,514.858,4,77
that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points. ,514.858,518.858,4,77
And all of these are the same principles that apply ,518.858,522.858,4,77
to the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods. ,522.858,524.858,2,77
In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot ,524.858,527.858,3,77
of extra material requirements for building it. ,527.858,530.858,3,77
"So, very interesting parallels between the biological ",530.858,533.858,3,77
"and the engineering worlds. And interestingly, this turns out -- ",533.858,537.858,4,77
the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first ,537.858,539.858,2,77
described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring. ,539.858,542.858,3,77
"That's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting. ",542.858,545.858,3,77
"So the next and final question was, well, how much force ",545.858,548.858,3,77
does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails? ,548.858,552.858,4,77
And so I wired up what's called a load cell. ,552.858,554.858,2,77
"A load cell measures forces, and this is actually ",554.858,556.858,2,77
a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it. ,556.858,559.858,3,77
"And when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change ",559.858,563.858,4,77
and it -- which -- in proportion to the forces that go in. ,563.858,565.858,2,77
"So these animals are wonderfully aggressive, ",565.858,568.858,3,77
and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do ,568.858,571.858,3,77
"was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell, ",571.858,574.858,3,77
and they'd smash away at it. ,574.858,576.858,2,77
And so this is just a regular video of the animal ,576.858,580.858,4,77
just smashing the heck out of this load cell. ,580.858,583.858,3,77
And we were able to get some force measurements out. ,583.858,586.858,3,77
"And again, we were in for a surprise. ",586.858,588.858,2,77
"I purchased a 100-pound load cell, thinking, ",588.858,590.858,2,77
no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal. ,590.858,594.858,4,77
And what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell. ,594.858,596.858,2,77
So these are actually some old data ,596.858,598.858,2,77
"where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab, ",598.858,600.858,2,77
and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds ,600.858,603.858,3,77
generated by an animal about this big. ,603.858,606.858,3,77
"And actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell ",606.858,608.858,2,77
"up and running, and I've clocked these animals generating ",608.858,611.858,3,77
well over 200 pounds of force. ,611.858,613.858,2,77
"And again, I think this will be a world record. ",613.858,616.858,3,77
"I have to do a little bit more background reading, ",616.858,618.858,2,77
but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced ,618.858,621.858,3,77
"by an animal of a given -- per body mass. So, really incredible forces. ",621.858,626.858,5,77
"And again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring ",626.858,629.858,3,77
in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system. ,629.858,633.858,4,77
But that was not the end of the story. ,633.858,635.858,2,77
"Now, things -- I'm making this sound very easy, this is actually a lot of work. ",635.858,638.858,3,77
"And I got all these force measurements, ",638.858,640.858,2,77
and then I went and looked at the force output of the system. ,640.858,644.858,4,77
And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis ,644.858,647.858,3,77
and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks. ,647.858,650.858,3,77
And that was what really got me puzzled. ,650.858,654.858,4,77
"The first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell. ",654.858,657.858,3,77
"But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later, ",657.858,663.858,6,77
and I didn't know what that was. ,663.858,665.858,2,77
"So now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons, ",665.858,668.858,3,77
but not half a millisecond later. ,668.858,670.858,2,77
"Again, going back to those high-speed videos, ",670.858,672.858,2,77
there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on. ,672.858,676.858,4,77
Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier. ,676.858,678.858,2,77
"There's that raptorial appendage -- there's the heel, ",678.858,681.858,3,77
and it's going to swing around and hit the load cell. ,681.858,684.858,3,77
"And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this, ",684.858,687.858,3,77
"on the surface of the load cell, as the limb comes flying through. ",687.858,692.858,5,77
And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light. ,692.858,697.858,5,77
Audience: Wow. ,697.858,699.858,2,77
"Sheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there ",699.858,703.858,4,77
at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble. ,703.858,706.858,3,77
"And what that is, is cavitation. ",706.858,708.858,2,77
And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon ,708.858,712.858,4,77
which occurs when you have areas of water ,712.858,715.858,3,77
moving at extremely different speeds. ,715.858,717.858,2,77
"And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure, ",717.858,721.858,4,77
which results in the water literally vaporizing. ,721.858,724.858,3,77
"And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat, ",724.858,728.858,4,77
and it's a very destructive process. ,728.858,730.858,2,77
"And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation ",730.858,735.858,5,77
"where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon, ",735.858,738.858,3,77
because it destroys boat propellers. ,738.858,740.858,2,77
People have been struggling for years to try and design ,740.858,743.858,3,77
a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate ,743.858,747.858,4,77
"and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it, ",747.858,749.858,2,77
just like these pictures show. ,749.858,751.858,2,77
"So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further, ",751.858,760.858,9,77
I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail. ,760.858,763.858,3,77
"This is taken at 20,000 frames per second, and I have to give ",763.858,767.858,4,77
"full credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up, ",767.858,771.858,4,77
because I could never have done this in a million years -- ,771.858,774.858,3,77
one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen. ,774.858,777.858,3,77
"You can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light, ",777.858,781.858,4,77
and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail. ,781.858,785.858,4,77
"So really, just an amazing image, ",785.858,788.858,3,77
"slowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds. ",788.858,792.858,4,77
"And again, we can see it in slightly different form there, ",792.858,795.858,3,77
with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces. ,795.858,799.858,4,77
"In fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb. ",799.858,804.858,5,77
So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks: ,804.858,807.858,3,77
what I think was going on is: that first impact is actually ,807.858,809.858,2,77
"the limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually ",809.858,812.858,3,77
the collapse of the cavitation bubble. ,812.858,814.858,2,77
And these animals may very well be making use of ,814.858,817.858,3,77
"not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring, ",817.858,821.858,4,77
but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be ,821.858,825.858,4,77
making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail. ,825.858,829.858,4,77
"So, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals. ",829.858,835.858,6,77
"So, one question I often get after this talk -- ",835.858,837.858,2,77
"so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal? ",837.858,840.858,3,77
"Because obviously, if it's breaking snails, ",840.858,843.858,3,77
the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does. ,843.858,846.858,3,77
"That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images, ",846.858,849.858,3,77
"and it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away ",849.858,851.858,2,77
their heel all the way to the flesh. ,851.858,853.858,2,77
But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod ,853.858,856.858,3,77
is that you have to molt. And every three months or so ,856.858,859.858,3,77
"these animals molt, and they build a new limb and it's no problem. ",859.858,864.858,5,77
"Very, very convenient solution to that particular problem. ",864.858,868.858,4,77
"So, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note. ",868.858,873.858,5,77
(Laughter) ,873.858,876.858,3,77
"Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you, I don't know. ",876.858,880.858,4,77
(Laughter) ,880.858,881.858,1,77
"So, the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring -- ",881.858,884.858,3,77
"has actually been well known to biologists for a long time, ",884.858,888.858,4,77
not as a spring but as a visual signal. ,888.858,892.858,4,77
And there's actually a spectacular colored dot ,892.858,894.858,2,77
in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods. ,894.858,900.858,6,77
"And this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins ",900.858,903.858,3,77
"of visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring. ",903.858,909.858,6,77
And I think one explanation for this could be ,909.858,911.858,2,77
going back to the molting phenomenon. ,911.858,913.858,2,77
So these animals go into a molting period where they're ,913.858,916.858,3,77
unable to strike -- their bodies become very soft. ,916.858,919.858,3,77
And they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct. ,919.858,922.858,3,77
"This is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period ",922.858,929.858,7,77
"when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful, ",929.858,932.858,3,77
and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what. ,932.858,936.858,4,77
"And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more, ",936.858,940.858,4,77
they just signal. They wave their legs around. ,940.858,943.858,3,77
And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing. ,943.858,947.858,4,77
It's a well-established fact of these animals ,947.858,949.858,2,77
"that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to. ",949.858,953.858,4,77
And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots ,953.858,955.858,2,77
in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information ,955.858,959.858,4,77
"about their ability to strike, or their strike force, ",959.858,962.858,3,77
and something about the time period in the molting cycle. ,962.858,965.858,3,77
So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure ,965.858,970.858,5,77
right in the middle of their spring. ,970.858,973.858,3,77
"So to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators, ",973.858,978.858,5,77
"Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this. ",978.858,981.858,3,77
"And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, ",981.858,984.858,3,77
"which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time, ",984.858,988.858,4,77
and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much. ,988.858,991.858,3,77
I thought in getting up to my TED wish ,24.858,30.858,6,85
I would try to begin by putting in  perspective what I try to do,30.858,37.858,7,85
and how it fits with what they try to do. ,37.858,41.858,4,85
"We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent, ",41.858,46.858,5,85
but insufficient in three major ways. ,46.858,52.858,6,85
"It is, first of all, profoundly unequal: ",52.858,55.858,3,85
half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day; ,55.858,59.858,4,85
a billion people with no access to clean water; ,59.858,61.858,2,85

and the variety of infections associated with dirty water -- ,71.858,75.858,4,85
80 percent of them under five years of age. ,75.858,78.858,3,85
Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing. ,78.858,84.858,6,85
"In the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth, ",84.858,89.858,5,85
"five years of productivity growth in the workplace, ",89.858,92.858,3,85
but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families ,92.858,96.858,4,85

which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do ,108.858,112.858,4,85

"weapons of mass destruction, the spread of global disease ",124.858,127.858,3,85

because more than half the world's people ,239.858,241.858,2,85
live under governments they voted in and can vote out. ,241.858,244.858,3,85
And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion. ,244.858,248.858,4,85
"Because primarily of the power of the Internet, ",248.858,253.858,5,85
people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money ,253.858,259.858,6,85
that can change the world for some public good if they all agree. ,259.858,263.858,4,85
"When the tsunami hit South Asia, the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars. ",263.858,268.858,5,85
30 percent of our households gave. ,268.858,270.858,2,85
Half of them gave over the Internet. ,270.858,272.858,2,85
The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars. ,272.858,277.858,5,85
"And thirdly, because of the rise of non-governmental organizations. ",278.858,283.858,5,85
"They, businesses, other citizens' groups, have enormous power ",283.858,289.858,6,85
to affect the lives of our fellow human beings. ,289.858,293.858,4,85
"When I became president in 1993, ",294.858,296.858,2,85
there were none of these organizations in Russia. ,296.858,298.858,2,85
There are now a couple of hundred thousand. ,298.858,300.858,2,85
None in India. There are now at least a half a million active. ,300.858,304.858,4,85
"None in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government, ",304.858,307.858,3,85
probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons. ,307.858,312.858,5,85
"When I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is ",313.858,321.858,8,85
"and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation, ",321.858,326.858,5,85
and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life ,326.858,333.858,7,85
that I could still have an impact on. ,333.858,335.858,2,85
I wanted to focus on activities ,335.858,338.858,3,85
"that would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change, ",338.858,345.858,7,85
"bridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world, ",345.858,349.858,4,85
but to do it in a way that would either use ,349.858,353.858,4,85
whatever particular skills we could put together in our group ,353.858,359.858,6,85
to change the way some public good function was performed ,359.858,364.858,5,85
so that it would sweep across the world more. ,364.858,367.858,3,85
You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs. ,367.858,373.858,6,85
"And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort, ",373.858,376.858,3,85
"and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight, ",376.858,380.858,4,85
"Ira Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done. ",380.858,384.858,4,85
He's over there. ,384.858,386.858,2,85
(Applause) ,386.858,390.858,4,85
"When I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean, ",390.858,396.858,6,85
"to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis, ",396.858,399.858,3,85
generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year. ,399.858,403.858,4,85
"If you bought them in vast bulks, ",403.858,405.858,2,85
you could get them at a little under 400 dollars. ,405.858,408.858,3,85
"The first country we went to work in, the Bahamas, ",408.858,411.858,3,85
"was paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs. ",411.858,413.858,2,85
The market was so terribly disorganized ,413.858,416.858,3,85
that they were buying this medicine through two agents ,416.858,420.858,4,85
who were gigging them sevenfold. ,420.858,422.858,2,85
"So the very first week we were working, ",423.858,426.858,3,85
we got the price down to 500 dollars. ,426.858,428.858,2,85
"And all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many lives ",428.858,430.858,2,85
for the same amount of money. ,430.858,432.858,2,85
"Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines, ",432.858,435.858,3,85
"one of whom was cited in the film, ",435.858,437.858,2,85
"and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy, ",437.858,442.858,5,85
"because even at 500 dollars, these drugs ",442.858,445.858,3,85
"were being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis. ",445.858,450.858,5,85
So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations ,450.858,454.858,4,85
"and the supply chain, and went to a low-margin, high-volume, ",454.858,458.858,4,85
absolutely certain-payment business. ,458.858,460.858,2,85
I joked that the main contribution we made ,460.858,463.858,3,85
to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers ,463.858,464.858,1,85
to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy. ,464.858,469.858,5,85
But the price went to 140 dollars from 500. ,470.858,474.858,4,85
"And pretty soon, the average price was 192 dollars. ",474.858,478.858,4,85
Now we can get it for about 100 dollars. ,478.858,480.858,2,85
"Children's medicine was 600 dollars, ",480.858,482.858,2,85
because nobody could afford to buy any of it. ,482.858,484.858,2,85
We negotiated it down to 190. ,484.858,487.858,3,85
"Then, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax ",487.858,491.858,4,85
"to create a something called UNITAID, ",491.858,493.858,2,85
got a bunch of other countries to help. ,493.858,495.858,2,85
That children's medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year. ,495.858,498.858,3,85
The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives ,498.858,503.858,5,85
of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive ,503.858,505.858,2,85
"are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care ",505.858,508.858,3,85
for people and deliver this medicine. ,508.858,512.858,4,85
We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America. ,512.858,516.858,4,85
We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals ,516.858,519.858,3,85
with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric ,519.858,524.858,5,85
and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools. ,524.858,528.858,4,85
We just reorganized the markets. ,528.858,531.858,3,85
"And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world, ",531.858,536.858,5,85
somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets. ,536.858,541.858,5,85
"And that is now what we're trying to do, ",541.858,543.858,2,85
"and working with this large cities group to fight climate change, ",543.858,546.858,3,85
"to negotiate huge, big, volume deals that will enable cities ",546.858,551.858,5,85
"which generate 75 percent of the world's greenhouse gases, ",551.858,554.858,3,85
to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions ,554.858,557.858,3,85
in a way that is good economics. ,557.858,560.858,3,85
"And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden, ",561.858,565.858,4,85
is a mystery to me. ,565.858,566.858,1,85
I think it's a bird's nest on the ground. ,566.858,568.858,2,85
When Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar ,568.858,572.858,4,85
"for the ""Inconvenient Truth"" movie, I was thrilled, ",572.858,576.858,4,85
but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly. ,576.858,580.858,4,85
"For those of you who saw ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" ",580.858,584.858,4,85
"the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one, ",584.858,589.858,5,85
which shows here's where greenhouse gases are going ,589.858,592.858,3,85
"if we don't do anything, here's where they could go. ",592.858,594.858,2,85
And then there are six different categories ,594.858,596.858,2,85
of things we can do to change the trajectory. ,596.858,598.858,2,85
We need a movie on those six categories. ,598.858,601.858,3,85
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains ,601.858,604.858,3,85
and to organize yourselves around it. ,604.858,607.858,3,85
So we're trying to do that. ,607.858,609.858,2,85
So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do. ,609.858,612.858,3,85
"Now we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish. ",612.858,616.858,4,85
It has been my experience in working in developing countries ,616.858,620.858,4,85
"that while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say, ",621.858,625.858,4,85
"well, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption -- ",625.858,629.858,4,85
"I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption, ",629.858,635.858,6,85
and feeds corruption. ,635.858,638.858,3,85
"We now have the money, given these low prices, to distribute ",639.858,642.858,3,85
AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach. ,642.858,647.858,5,85
"Today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work, ",649.858,653.858,4,85
"and in a total of 62 countries, ",653.858,655.858,2,85
"and about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them. ",655.858,659.858,4,85
But the money is there to reach others. ,659.858,662.858,3,85
The systems are not there to reach the people. ,662.858,665.858,3,85
"So what we have been trying to do, ",665.858,673.858,8,85
working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places -- ,673.858,679.858,6,85
but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight -- ,679.858,681.858,2,85
is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area ,681.858,689.858,8,85
"that can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases, ",689.858,693.858,4,85
"maternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues ",693.858,696.858,3,85
"poor people are grappling with in the developing world, ",696.858,699.858,3,85
"that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda, ",699.858,703.858,4,85
and then will be a model that could literally ,703.858,705.858,2,85
be implemented in any other poor country in the world. ,705.858,707.858,2,85
"And the test is: one, will it do the job? ",707.858,709.858,2,85
Will it provide high quality care? ,709.858,712.858,3,85
"And two, will it do it at a price ",712.858,714.858,2,85
that will enable the country to sustain a health care system ,714.858,718.858,4,85
without foreign donors after five to 10 years? ,718.858,722.858,4,85
"Because the longer I deal with these problems, ",722.858,726.858,4,85
the more convinced I am that we have to -- ,726.858,728.858,2,85
"whether it's economics, health, education, whatever -- ",728.858,731.858,3,85
we have to build systems. ,731.858,733.858,2,85
And the absence of systems that function ,733.858,736.858,3,85
break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight. ,736.858,740.858,4,85
"You think about whatever your life has been, ",740.858,742.858,2,85
"however many obstacles you have faced in your life, ",742.858,745.858,3,85
at critical junctures you always knew ,745.858,748.858,3,85
there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted ,748.858,752.858,4,85
and the result you achieved. ,752.858,754.858,2,85
"In a world with no systems, with chaos, ",754.858,759.858,5,85
"everything becomes a guerilla struggle, ",759.858,762.858,3,85
and this predictability is not there. ,762.858,765.858,3,85
"And it becomes almost impossible to save lives, ",765.858,768.858,3,85
"educate kids, develop economies, whatever. ",768.858,771.858,3,85
"The person, in my view, ",771.858,774.858,3,85
"who has done the best job of this in the health care area, ",774.858,779.858,5,85
"of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer, ",779.858,783.858,4,85
"who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group, ",783.858,788.858,5,85
"Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started, ",788.858,792.858,4,85
"but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru ",792.858,794.858,2,85
and other places around the world. ,794.858,796.858,2,85
"As poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active -- ",796.858,801.858,5,85
and they serve a catchment area far greater ,801.858,803.858,2,85
than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve -- ,803.858,807.858,4,85
"since 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one. ",807.858,814.858,7,85
And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results. ,814.858,819.858,5,85
So when we decided to work in Rwanda ,819.858,823.858,4,85
"on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem, ",823.858,828.858,5,85
"we wanted to build a healthcare network, ",828.858,830.858,2,85
"because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994, ",830.858,834.858,4,85
and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day. ,834.858,837.858,3,85
"So I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help. ",838.858,842.858,4,85
Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti ,843.858,846.858,3,85
"and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country, ",846.858,850.858,4,85
"number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country ",850.858,852.858,2,85
"that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years, ",852.858,856.858,4,85
"and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted ",856.858,860.858,4,85
to any other poor country anywhere in the world. ,860.858,863.858,3,85
And so we have set about doing that. ,864.858,868.858,4,85
"Now, we started working together 18 months ago. ",868.858,872.858,4,85
"And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza, ",872.858,876.858,4,85
"which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda, ",876.858,880.858,4,85
"with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people. ",880.858,886.858,6,85
We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti: ,886.858,891.858,5,85
he develops and trains paid community health workers ,891.858,896.858,5,85
"who are able to identify health problems, ",896.858,900.858,4,85
ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed ,900.858,904.858,4,85
"and take their medicine regularly, ",904.858,906.858,2,85
"who work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation, ",906.858,913.858,7,85
providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care ,913.858,918.858,5,85
if they have problems of the severity that require it. ,918.858,922.858,4,85
"The procedures that make this work have been perfected, ",922.858,927.858,5,85
"as I said, by Paul Farmer and his team ",927.858,930.858,3,85
in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years. ,930.858,933.858,3,85
Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda. ,933.858,939.858,6,85
And the results were so good that the Rwandan government ,939.858,944.858,5,85
"has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country, ",944.858,947.858,3,85
and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it. ,947.858,952.858,5,85
I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do. ,953.858,957.858,4,85
We have about 500 people around the world ,957.858,960.858,3,85
"working in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing -- ",960.858,964.858,4,85
"just for transportation, room and board. ",964.858,966.858,2,85
And then we have others working in these other related programs. ,966.858,970.858,4,85
Our business plan in Rwanda ,970.858,972.858,2,85
"was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble, ",972.858,975.858,3,85
"who is an unusually gifted woman, ",975.858,978.858,3,85
but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work. ,978.858,983.858,5,85
She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s. ,983.858,988.858,5,85
She was CEO of a successful e-venture -- ,988.858,990.858,2,85
she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures -- ,990.858,994.858,4,85
and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life. ,994.858,997.858,3,85
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay. ,997.858,1001.858,4,85
She and her team of former business people have created a business plan ,1001.858,1005.858,4,85
that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country. ,1005.858,1009.858,4,85
And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work ,1009.858,1014.858,5,85
she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it. ,1014.858,1018.858,4,85
"When we came to this rural area, 45 percent of the children under the age of five ",1018.858,1023.858,5,85
had stunted growth due to malnutrition. ,1023.858,1028.858,5,85
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five. ,1028.858,1034.858,6,85
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent. ,1036.858,1039.858,3,85
Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred ,1039.858,1043.858,4,85
because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation -- ,1043.858,1048.858,5,85
all entirely preventable and treatable. ,1048.858,1051.858,3,85
Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses -- ,1051.858,1055.858,4,85
"again, all preventable and treatable. ",1055.858,1058.858,3,85
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis. ,1058.858,1063.858,5,85
"Within the first 18 months, the following things happened: ",1064.858,1068.858,4,85
"we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS. ",1068.858,1072.858,4,85
That's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area. ,1072.858,1076.858,4,85
Listen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated ,1076.858,1081.858,5,85
stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment. ,1081.858,1085.858,4,85
That's lower than the figure in the United States. ,1085.858,1088.858,3,85
Less than three-tenths of one percent ,1088.858,1090.858,2,85
had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs. ,1090.858,1095.858,5,85
"400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling ",1095.858,1099.858,4,85
and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system. ,1099.858,1104.858,5,85
That's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies. ,1104.858,1109.858,5,85
"About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. I meant 40,000. ",1109.858,1113.858,4,85
About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it -- ,1113.858,1117.858,4,85
"in just 18 months, up from zero when we started. ",1117.858,1121.858,4,85
43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program ,1121.858,1124.858,3,85
to prevent malnutrition and early death ,1124.858,1126.858,2,85
are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow. ,1126.858,1129.858,3,85
We've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there. ,1129.858,1133.858,4,85
Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide ,1133.858,1138.858,5,85
"that we have renovated along with four other clinics, ",1138.858,1143.858,5,85
"complete with solar power generators, good lab technology. ",1143.858,1148.858,5,85
"We now are treating 325 people a month, ",1148.858,1153.858,5,85
despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home. ,1153.858,1158.858,5,85
And the most important thing is ,1159.858,1162.858,3,85
"because we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers, ",1162.858,1167.858,5,85
we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda ,1167.858,1173.858,6,85
"for between five and six percent of GDP, ",1173.858,1177.858,4,85
and that the government could sustain that ,1177.858,1181.858,4,85
without depending on foreign aid after five or six years. ,1181.858,1186.858,5,85
And for those of you who understand healthcare economics ,1187.858,1189.858,2,85
you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP ,1189.858,1194.858,5,85
"on health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 -- ",1194.858,1196.858,2,85
but that's a story for another day. ,1196.858,1198.858,2,85
(Laughter) ,1199.858,1200.858,1,85
We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda ,1201.858,1206.858,5,85
and our Foundation folks to scale this system up. ,1206.858,1210.858,4,85
We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho. ,1210.858,1216.858,6,85
"And we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique, ",1216.858,1220.858,4,85
Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing: ,1220.858,1225.858,5,85
"to save as many lives as quickly as we can, ",1225.858,1227.858,2,85
but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide ,1227.858,1230.858,3,85
and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world. ,1230.858,1234.858,4,85
"We need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses, ",1234.858,1238.858,4,85
"health administration and community health workers throughout the country, ",1238.858,1241.858,3,85
"to set up the information technology, the solar energy, ",1241.858,1244.858,3,85
"the water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure. ",1244.858,1247.858,3,85
"But over a five- to 10-year period, ",1247.858,1250.858,3,85
we will take down the need for outside assistance ,1250.858,1252.858,2,85
and eventually it will be phased out. ,1252.858,1254.858,2,85
My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build ,1255.858,1263.858,8,85
"a high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda, ",1263.858,1267.858,4,85
"that can be a model for Africa, ",1267.858,1269.858,2,85
"and indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world. ",1269.858,1274.858,5,85
My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world ,1274.858,1280.858,6,85
"with more partners and fewer terrorists, ",1280.858,1283.858,3,85
"with more productive citizens and fewer haters, ",1283.858,1286.858,3,85
a place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in. ,1286.858,1291.858,5,85
"It has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda ",1292.858,1298.858,6,85
where we also have a major economic development project ,1298.858,1301.858,3,85
"in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist, ",1301.858,1306.858,5,85
"where last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs, ",1306.858,1309.858,3,85
cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent ,1309.858,1315.858,6,85
and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases ,1315.858,1319.858,4,85
in crop yields with the farmers. ,1319.858,1321.858,2,85
"These people have been through a lot and none of us, most of all me, ",1321.858,1327.858,6,85
helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other. ,1327.858,1330.858,3,85
"We're undoing that now, and they are so over it and so into their future. ",1331.858,1337.858,6,85
We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way. ,1337.858,1341.858,4,85
I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid ,1341.858,1345.858,4,85
"to the 35 percent of the people that have no access, ",1345.858,1348.858,3,85
"but to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects, ",1348.858,1353.858,5,85
"the Rwandans, interestingly enough, have been quite good, Mr. Wilson, ",1353.858,1357.858,4,85
in preserving their topsoil. ,1357.858,1359.858,2,85
There's a couple of guys from southern farming families -- ,1359.858,1363.858,4,85
the first thing I did when I went out to this place ,1363.858,1365.858,2,85
was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt ,1365.858,1367.858,2,85
and see what they'd done with it. ,1367.858,1369.858,2,85
We have a chance here to prove that a country ,1369.858,1373.858,4,85
that almost slaughtered itself out of existence ,1373.858,1378.858,5,85
"can practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow ",1379.858,1386.858,7,85
"and provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help. ",1386.858,1393.858,7,85
"I am grateful for this prize, and I will use it to that end. ",1393.858,1399.858,6,85
"We could use some more help to do this, ",1399.858,1403.858,4,85
but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system ,1403.858,1407.858,4,85
"in Rwanda -- in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income, ",1407.858,1412.858,5,85
one that could save hundreds of millions of lives ,1412.858,1416.858,4,85
over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth. ,1416.858,1423.858,7,85
It's worth a try and I believe it would succeed. ,1423.858,1427.858,4,85
Thank you and God bless you. ,1427.858,1430.858,3,85
"I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin, ",24.858,27.858,3,91
from when I was 12 years old. ,27.858,29.858,2,91
My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater -- ,29.858,32.858,3,91
at least I thought it was beautiful. ,32.858,34.858,2,91
"And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach, ",34.858,37.858,3,91
and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of ,37.858,40.858,3,91
"right across the chest, that were also fuzzy. ",40.858,42.858,2,91
"And I wore it whenever I could, ",42.858,43.858,1,91
thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned. ,43.858,46.858,3,91
"Until one day in ninth grade, ",46.858,48.858,2,91
when I was standing with a number of the football players. ,48.858,51.858,3,91
"And my body had clearly changed, and Matt, ",51.858,55.858,4,91
"who was undeniably my nemesis in high school, ",55.858,59.858,4,91
said in a booming voice that ,59.858,60.858,1,91
"we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips, ",60.858,64.858,4,91
but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz. ,64.858,66.858,2,91
(Laughter) ,66.858,67.858,1,91
And I was so humiliated and mortified ,67.858,70.858,3,91
that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her ,70.858,74.858,4,91
for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater. ,74.858,75.858,1,91
We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away ,75.858,78.858,3,91
"somewhat ceremoniously, ",78.858,80.858,2,91
my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater ,80.858,83.858,3,91
nor see it ever again. ,83.858,84.858,1,91
"Fast forward -- 11 years later, I'm a 25-year-old kid. ",84.858,88.858,4,91
"I'm working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes, ",88.858,95.858,7,91
"when I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy -- 11 years old -- ",95.858,99.858,4,91
"running toward me, wearing my sweater. ",99.858,102.858,3,91
"And I'm thinking, no, this is not possible. ",102.858,104.858,2,91
"But so, curious, I run up to the child -- of course ",104.858,108.858,4,91
scaring the living bejesus out of him -- ,108.858,110.858,2,91
"grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name ",110.858,113.858,3,91
written on the collar of this sweater. ,113.858,115.858,2,91
"I tell that story, because it has served and continues to serve ",115.858,120.858,5,91
as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness ,120.858,124.858,4,91
that we all have on this Earth. ,124.858,126.858,2,91
We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction ,126.858,130.858,4,91
does to people we think we will never see and never know. ,130.858,133.858,3,91
I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story ,134.858,137.858,3,91
of what aid is and can be. ,137.858,139.858,2,91
"That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia, ",139.858,143.858,4,91
"and moved its way into the larger industry, ",143.858,146.858,3,91
which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia. ,146.858,150.858,4,91
"Which was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing. ",150.858,154.858,4,91
"And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda, ",154.858,156.858,2,91
it destroyed the local retailing industry. ,156.858,158.858,2,91
"Not to say that it shouldn't have, ",158.858,160.858,2,91
but that we have to get better at answering the questions ,160.858,163.858,3,91
that need to be considered when we think about consequences ,163.858,166.858,3,91
and responses. ,166.858,168.858,2,91
"So, I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986, ",168.858,173.858,5,91
where I was doing two things. ,173.858,174.858,1,91
I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers. ,174.858,177.858,3,91
"We were called the ""Bad News Bears,"" and our notion was ",177.858,179.858,2,91
"we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali, ",179.858,182.858,3,91
which was not hard because there were no snacks before us. ,182.858,185.858,3,91
"And because we had a good business model, we actually did it, ",186.858,189.858,3,91
and I watched these women transform on a micro-level. ,189.858,191.858,2,91
"But at the same time, I started a micro-finance bank, ",191.858,194.858,3,91
"and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen, ",194.858,197.858,3,91
"which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks, ",197.858,200.858,3,91
which now is a worldwide movement -- you talk about a meme -- ,200.858,202.858,2,91
"but then it was quite new, especially in an economy ",203.858,206.858,3,91
that was moving from barter into trade. ,206.858,209.858,3,91
We got a lot of things right. ,209.858,211.858,2,91
We focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game. ,211.858,214.858,3,91
The women made their own decisions at the end of the day ,214.858,217.858,3,91
as to how they would use this access to credit ,217.858,219.858,2,91
"to build their little businesses, earn more income ",219.858,222.858,3,91
so they could take care of their families better. ,222.858,224.858,2,91
"What we didn't understand, what was happening all around us, ",225.858,229.858,4,91
"with the confluence of fear, ethnic strife ",229.858,235.858,6,91
"and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into ",236.858,240.858,4,91
"this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda, ",241.858,247.858,6,91
"that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid. ",247.858,250.858,3,91
"The genocide happened in 1994, ",250.858,252.858,2,91
seven years after these women all worked together ,252.858,254.858,2,91
to build this dream. ,254.858,256.858,2,91
"And the good news was that the institution, ",256.858,258.858,2,91
"the banking institution, lasted. ",258.858,260.858,2,91
"In fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country. ",260.858,263.858,3,91
"The bakery was completely wiped out, ",264.858,266.858,2,91
but the lessons for me were that accountability counts -- ,266.858,270.858,4,91
"got to build things with people on the ground, ",271.858,273.858,2,91
"using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say, ",273.858,276.858,3,91
the incentives matter. ,276.858,278.858,2,91
"Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter. ",278.858,282.858,4,91
So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything ,282.858,286.858,4,91
"that was happening in the world, ",286.858,288.858,2,91
"that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist, ",288.858,290.858,2,91
"on the one hand I absolutely agree with him, ",290.858,292.858,2,91
and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 -- ,292.858,295.858,3,91
"that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono ",295.858,299.858,4,91
and Bob Geldof -- the world is talking about global poverty; ,299.858,303.858,4,91
the world is talking about Africa ,303.858,305.858,2,91
in ways I have never seen in my life. ,305.858,307.858,2,91
It's thrilling. ,307.858,308.858,1,91
"And at the same time, what keeps me up at night ",308.858,311.858,3,91
is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 -- ,311.858,315.858,4,91
"50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa, ",315.858,318.858,3,91
"40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory, ",318.858,321.858,3,91
"as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution. ",321.858,325.858,4,91
"And in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one, ",325.858,329.858,4,91
"celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two ",329.858,333.858,4,91
"that is all about execution, all about the how-to. ",333.858,335.858,2,91
"And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today, ",336.858,339.858,3,91
"it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history, ",339.858,343.858,4,91
is to build viable systems on the ground ,343.858,346.858,3,91
"that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor, ",346.858,350.858,4,91
in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable. ,350.858,353.858,3,91
"If we do that, we really can make poverty history. ",353.858,356.858,3,91
And it was that -- that whole philosophy -- ,356.858,359.858,3,91
that encouraged me to start my current endeavor ,359.858,363.858,4,91
"called ""Acumen Fund,"" ",363.858,365.858,2,91
which is trying to build some mini-blueprints ,365.858,367.858,2,91
"for how we might do that in water, health and housing ",367.858,370.858,3,91
"in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt. ",370.858,373.858,3,91
"And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples, ",373.858,378.858,5,91
so you can see what it is that we're doing. ,378.858,380.858,2,91
But before I do this -- and this is another one of my pet peeves -- ,380.858,383.858,3,91
I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are. ,383.858,385.858,2,91
Because we too often talk about them as these ,385.858,389.858,4,91
"strong, huge masses of people yearning to be free, ",389.858,392.858,3,91
"when in fact, it's quite an amazing story. ",392.858,397.858,5,91
"On a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day. ",397.858,402.858,5,91
"That's who we talk about when we think about ""the poor."" ",402.858,404.858,2,91
"If you aggregate it, it's the third largest economy on Earth, ",404.858,407.858,3,91
and yet most of these people go invisible. ,407.858,409.858,2,91
"Where we typically work, there's people making between ",410.858,412.858,2,91
one and three dollars a day. ,412.858,414.858,2,91
Who are these people? ,414.858,416.858,2,91
They are farmers and factory workers. ,416.858,419.858,3,91
They work in government offices. They're drivers. ,419.858,421.858,2,91
They are domestics. ,421.858,424.858,3,91
"They typically pay for critical goods and services like water, ",424.858,427.858,3,91
"like healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 times ",427.858,431.858,4,91
what their middleclass counterparts pay -- ,431.858,433.858,2,91
certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi. ,433.858,436.858,3,91
"The poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions, ",437.858,441.858,4,91
if you give them that opportunity. ,441.858,443.858,2,91
"So, two examples. ",443.858,445.858,2,91
"One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers, ",445.858,448.858,3,91
most of whom make less than two dollars a day. ,448.858,450.858,2,91
"Where we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched. ",450.858,453.858,3,91
You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar. ,454.858,457.858,3,91
This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar. ,457.858,460.858,3,91
"What he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches, ",461.858,464.858,3,91
"and figure out how to do a drip irrigation, ",464.858,467.858,3,91
which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock. ,467.858,471.858,4,91
"But previously it's only been created for large-scale farms, ",472.858,475.858,3,91
so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre. ,475.858,480.858,5,91
A couple of principles: ,480.858,482.858,2,91
build small. ,482.858,484.858,2,91
Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor. ,484.858,486.858,2,91
"This family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit ",486.858,491.858,5,91
when they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-to ,491.858,494.858,3,91
with a corrugated iron roof. ,494.858,496.858,2,91
"After one harvest, they had increased their income enough ",497.858,501.858,4,91
to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre. ,501.858,504.858,3,91
"A couple of years later, I meet them. ",504.858,506.858,2,91
"They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India, ",506.858,509.858,3,91
and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid ,509.858,514.858,5,91
to build their house. ,514.858,515.858,1,91
"And I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes. ",515.858,518.858,3,91
Something I truly believe. ,518.858,520.858,2,91
"You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets, ",520.858,523.858,3,91
and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard ,523.858,526.858,3,91
huge kudos for bringing to the world ,526.858,529.858,3,91
this notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life. ,529.858,533.858,4,91
Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year. ,533.858,537.858,4,91
300 to 500 million cases are reported. ,537.858,539.858,2,91
It's estimated that Africa loses ,539.858,541.858,2,91
about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease. ,541.858,543.858,2,91
Five dollars can save a life. ,543.858,545.858,2,91
We can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars -- ,545.858,548.858,3,91
why can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people? ,548.858,551.858,3,91
"The question, though, is not ""Why can't we?"" ",552.858,555.858,3,91
The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves? ,555.858,559.858,4,91
A lot of hurdles. ,560.858,561.858,1,91
One: production is too low. Two: price is too high. ,561.858,564.858,3,91
Three: this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located. ,564.858,569.858,5,91
"Distribution is a nightmare, but not impossible. ",569.858,572.858,3,91
"We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan ",572.858,575.858,3,91
to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa ,576.858,578.858,2,91
so that they could transfer technology from Japan ,578.858,583.858,5,91
"and build these long-lasting, five-year nets. ",583.858,585.858,2,91
Here are just some pictures of the factory. ,585.858,587.858,2,91
"Today, three years later, the company has employed ",587.858,590.858,3,91
another thousand women. ,590.858,592.858,2,91
"It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania. ",593.858,598.858,5,91
It's the largest company in Tanzania. ,598.858,600.858,2,91
"The throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets, ",600.858,603.858,3,91
three million by the end of the year. ,603.858,605.858,2,91
We hope to have seven million at the end of next year. ,605.858,607.858,2,91
So the production side is working. ,608.858,610.858,2,91
"On the distribution side, though, ",610.858,611.858,1,91
"as a world, we have a lot of work to do. ",611.858,613.858,2,91
"Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N., ",613.858,617.858,4,91
and then given primarily to people around Africa. ,617.858,621.858,4,91
We're looking at building ,621.858,623.858,2,91
on some of the most precious resources of Africa: people. ,623.858,626.858,3,91
Their women. ,626.858,628.858,2,91
"And so I want you to meet Jacqueline, ",628.858,630.858,2,91
"my namesake, 21 years old. ",630.858,632.858,2,91
"If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania, ",632.858,634.858,2,91
"I'm telling you, she could run Wall Street. ",634.858,636.858,2,91
"She runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough money ",636.858,640.858,4,91
to put a down payment on her house. ,640.858,642.858,2,91
"She makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund, ",642.858,646.858,4,91
and told me she is not marrying nor having children ,646.858,649.858,3,91
until these things are completed. ,649.858,652.858,3,91
"And so, when I told her about our idea -- ",652.858,654.858,2,91
"that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States, ",654.858,657.858,3,91
and find a way for the women themselves to go out ,657.858,660.858,3,91
and sell these nets to others -- ,660.858,662.858,2,91
she quickly started calculating what she herself could make ,662.858,665.858,3,91
and signed up. ,665.858,667.858,2,91
"We took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies, ",667.858,672.858,5,91
"and quickly did a prototyping on this, ",672.858,674.858,2,91
and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives. ,674.858,677.858,3,91
She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts ,677.858,681.858,4,91
"together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece, ",681.858,683.858,2,91
"despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one, ",683.858,686.858,3,91
and we learned a lot about how you sell things. ,686.858,689.858,3,91
"Not coming in with our own notions, ",689.858,691.858,2,91
because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end. ,691.858,693.858,2,91
"First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty. ",693.858,696.858,3,91
"These nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house. ",696.858,699.858,3,91
Children can sleep through the night; ,699.858,701.858,2,91
the house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window. ,701.858,703.858,2,91
"And we've started making curtains, ",703.858,705.858,2,91
"and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status -- ",705.858,709.858,4,91
that you care about your children. ,709.858,710.858,1,91
Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives. ,710.858,714.858,4,91
A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell ,715.858,718.858,3,91
goods and services to the poor. ,718.858,721.858,3,91
I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity ,722.858,726.858,4,91
to make poverty history. ,727.858,729.858,2,91
"To do it right, we have to build business models that matter, ",729.858,732.858,3,91
"that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians, ",732.858,736.858,4,91
people all over the developing world ,736.858,738.858,2,91
"who fit in this category, to do it themselves. ",738.858,741.858,3,91
"Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement. ",741.858,744.858,3,91
"It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts, ",744.858,747.858,3,91
that they want to make their own decisions; ,747.858,749.858,2,91
they want to solve their own problems; ,749.858,751.858,2,91
"and that by engaging with them, ",751.858,753.858,2,91
"not only do we create much more dignity for them, ",753.858,756.858,3,91
but for us as well. ,756.858,758.858,2,91
And so I urge all of you to think next time ,758.858,761.858,3,91
as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity ,761.858,765.858,4,91
that we all have -- to make poverty history -- ,765.858,768.858,3,91
by really becoming part of the process ,768.858,770.858,2,91
"and moving away from an us-and-them world, ",770.858,772.858,2,91
"and realizing that it's about all of us, ",772.858,774.858,2,91
"and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share. ",774.858,777.858,3,91
Thank you. ,777.858,778.858,1,91
